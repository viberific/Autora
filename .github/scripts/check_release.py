"""Fail a pull request that changes the app without changing what Umbrel reads.

Umbrel decides whether an update exists by comparing one string: `version` in
`blofstedt-autora/umbrel-app.yml`. Not the image digest, not the commit --
that one line. So a change can be merged, built, pushed to the registry and
sitting in the store, and the installed app will still report itself up to
date, because as far as Umbrel is concerned it is. There is nothing to notice
and nothing to retry: removing and re-adding the community store re-fetches the
same manifest and reaches the same conclusion.

That has now happened twice, both times costing a round trip through "why is
the update not showing", so it is checked here instead of remembered.

The rule: if a pull request changes anything that reaches the container, the
manifest has to say so -- a version that went up, and release notes that are
not the previous release's. A refactor with no user-facing effect is a real
thing, so `[no release]` in the pull request title or body opts out and says
why in the same place a reviewer is already looking.

What the pull request raises is `version` in package.json (the version the
image is built and tagged as) along with the release notes. The manifest's
`version` and the image tag in docker-compose.yml are left alone: the image
workflow moves both once that version's image is in the registry
(offer_release.py). Raised by hand, Umbrel offered the update minutes before
the image existed, and an update taken then failed with "manifest unknown".
