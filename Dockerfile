# Base images come through Google's pull-through mirror of Docker Hub's official images
# (mirror.gcr.io/library/<name>), the same images and tags. GitHub's shared runners were being
# refused by Docker Hub itself ("429 Too Many Requests", then a 504 from its login service),
# which failed every release before a line of Autora was built. The mirror needs no login.
# ── stage 0: the Office tools' spreadsheet engine ────────────────────────────
# The Word and PowerPoint half of the Office tools is JavaScript and is built in
# the next stage like everything else. The spreadsheet half is a Rust program
# (GenOffice's, pinned in office/PIN.json) with a C compression library in it,
# so it is built here, on the build machine, for both CPUs the image runs on,
# static against musl: `cargo zigbuild` brings the C cross-compiler (Zig), so
# there is no emulated arm64 build to wait hours for. Only the pin and the
# script are copied in, so this layer is rebuilt when the pin changes and not
# when the app does. It is optional: if it fails to build the image still
# builds, and only the Excel tools are missing (the script says so).

# and its headless command line, which the agent's photo_* tools run, built
# static against musl for both CPUs the image runs on, the same way as the

#
# On the machine doing the build, not the one the image is for. Everything it
# produces is JavaScript -- the bundle, and dependencies that are pure JS --
# so an amd64 build is the same bytes as an arm64 one, and running `npm ci`
# and the typecheck under arm64 emulation took minutes when it worked and
# hung the release for hours when it did not.
