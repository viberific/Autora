</p>

The agent's browser, terminal, desktop and file edits stream into the
conversation in real time — each command, page and edit shown at the point it
happened, and still there to scroll back to afterwards. Every session records
itself, and reading one back is reading the thread. Approval in chat is off:
nothing waits for you, and every command is still shown as it runs.

Built on one idea: **the event log is the product.** Everything the agent does
emits a typed event to an append-only log. The live view is a subscriber to that
log. A recording is that log read back. There is no separate recording pipeline
to bolt on, and no way for the live view and the recording to disagree — they
are the same code path.

```
  agent ──emit──> event log (jsonl + blobs) ──┬──> websocket ──> live UI
                       │                      └──> replay ─────> same UI
                       └── asciinema export, grep, tail -f
```

## Before you run it

Autora is an agent with your machine's reach, and it is built to use it. This is
the part to read before installing it anywhere.

- **It has no login of its own.** Run from the command line it binds `127.0.0.1`
  and refuses everything else: whoever can reach the port is the operator.
  Installed on Umbrel it sits behind the dashboard's own login. Do not put it on
  the open internet, and do not forward a port to it.
- **Approval in chat is off.** There is no per-call gate: commands run when the agent decides to run them, and
  you watch them happen rather than being asked first. That is the whole point of
  the app, and it is also the risk.
- **The Umbrel container is deliberately privileged.** The Umbrel compose mounts the host
  filesystem read-write at `/host` and sets `AUTORA_WORKDIR=/host`, because
  working on the server -- including deleting things -- is what it is for. The
  comments in `blofstedt-autora/docker-compose.yml` say so next to the mount.
  Run it on a machine you own, on a network you trust, in a VM if you can, and
  treat that machine as expendable.
- **Your provider keys stay on the server.** They are called from the server and
  never sent to the browser; a key saved in Settings is written to
  `.autora/settings.json`, readable only by the account Autora runs as.

## Install

Autora runs inside **Docker**, a free program that keeps it in its own sealed
box, so there is nothing else to set up. You do two things: install Docker, then
paste one command. Allow about 10 minutes, most of it downloading.

**Pick your system:** [Windows](#windows) · [Linux](#linux) · [Mac](#mac) · [Umbrel](#umbrel)

### Windows

You need Windows 10 (version 2004 or newer) or Windows 11.

1. **Install Docker Desktop** from <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/>.
   Run the installer, leave "Use WSL 2" ticked, and restart if it asks.
2. **Start it.** Open *Docker Desktop* from the Start menu, accept the terms
   (you can skip signing in), and wait until the bottom-left corner says
   *Engine running*.
3. **Start Autora.** Open *PowerShell* (Start menu, type "PowerShell"), paste
   these two lines, and press Enter. The first run downloads Autora, which takes
   a few minutes.

   ```powershell
   mkdir -Force "$HOME\autora-files"
   docker run -d --name autora --restart unless-stopped -p 127.0.0.1:8817:8817 -v autora-data:/data -v "$HOME\autora-files:/workspace" -e AUTORA_WORKDIR=/workspace ghcr.io/viberific/autora:latest
   ```

4. **Open <http://localhost:8817>** in your browser. Then
   [connect a model](#first-run-connect-a-model).

### Linux

1. **Install Docker.** On Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and most others, Docker's own
   script does it:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

   Then **log out and back in** so you can use Docker without `sudo`.
2. **Start Autora.** Paste this into a terminal. The first run downloads
   Autora, which takes a few minutes.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/autora-files
   docker run -d --name autora --restart unless-stopped -p 127.0.0.1:8817:8817 -v autora-data:/data -v ~/autora-files:/workspace -e AUTORA_WORKDIR=/workspace ghcr.io/viberific/autora:latest
   ```

3. **Open <http://localhost:8817>** in your browser. Then
   [connect a model](#first-run-connect-a-model).

### Mac

Install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/),
open it and wait for *Engine running*, then use the command from the
[Linux](#linux) section in Terminal.

### Umbrel

In umbrelOS open **App Store**, use the **⋯** menu at the top right, choose
**Community App Stores**, add `https://github.com/blofstedt/Autora`, then open
the store, pick **Autora** and press **Install**. Note that the Umbrel version
can reach the whole machine, not one folder — see
[Before you run it](#before-you-run-it).

### First run: connect a model

Autora opens on a card that asks for an AI model. **DeepSeek** is the cheapest
choice:

1. Make an account at <https://platform.deepseek.com> and add a few dollars of
   balance if it asks (you pay for what you use).
2. Open <https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys>, create a key and copy it.
3. In Autora choose **DeepSeek**, paste the key and press connect. Autora
   checks it before saving.

Any other provider works the same way: see [Connecting a model](#connecting-a-model).
Then type a task and watch it work.

### What it can reach

Autora can read and change the files in your **`autora-files`** folder, run
commands and browse the web from inside its box. It cannot see the rest of your
computer. Put in that folder whatever you want it to work on.
On Linux the files it creates belong to `root`; if you cannot edit them, run
`sudo chown -R $USER ~/autora-files`.

The commands above publish Autora to **this computer only** (`127.0.0.1`).
Autora has no login of its own, so do not remove that, and do not forward a port
to it. To reach it from a phone, see [Reaching it from a phone](#reaching-it-from-a-phone).

### Stop, update, remove

Run these in the same terminal or PowerShell:

| To | Run |
| --- | --- |
| Stop | `docker stop autora` |
| Start again | `docker start autora` |
| Update | `docker pull ghcr.io/viberific/autora:latest`, then `docker rm -f autora`, then the same start command as above. Your key and settings are kept. |
| Remove everything | `docker rm -f autora` then `docker volume rm autora-data` (this deletes your saved key and history; your `autora-files` folder stays) |

### If something goes wrong

- **"Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"** or **"error during connect"** —
  Docker is not running. On Windows, open Docker Desktop and wait for *Engine
  running*. On Linux, `sudo systemctl start docker`.
- **"permission denied" on `docker.sock`** (Linux) — you have not logged out and
  back in since `usermod`, or skipped it. Or put `sudo` in front of `docker`.
- **"port is already allocated"** — something else uses 8817. Change the first
  number, for example `-p 127.0.0.1:9000:8817`, and open
  <http://localhost:9000>.
- **"The container name /autora is already in use"** — run `docker rm -f autora`
  and paste the start command again.
- **"WSL 2 installation is incomplete"** or **"virtualization must be enabled"**
  (Windows) — restart the computer. If it persists, turn on virtualization
  (called Intel VT-x, AMD-V or SVM) in your computer's BIOS settings.
- **The page does not load** — `docker logs autora` shows what Autora said.

### Run it from source (for developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blofstedt/Autora && cd Autora
npm install

export GEMINI_API_KEY=...        # optional -- keys can also be added in Settings
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. It listens on this machine only. Opening it to
the network is a choice, and [Before you run it](#before-you-run-it) has the
terms: `AUTORA_HOST=0.0.0.0 npm run dev` when you want it from a phone or
another computer, on a network you trust. Requests and live connections started
by other websites are refused either way.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/first-run.png" width="780" alt="A fresh install: one column, and a card that asks which model to connect">
</p>

For production, `npm run build` then `npm start`. To build the image yourself
instead of pulling it: `docker build -t autora . && docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8817:8817 -v autora-data:/data autora`.

On Windows, do development in WSL (`wsl` from PowerShell), not with a Windows
Node: the code runs on Linux, and Windows builds of `tsx`, `esbuild` and
`node-pty` make modules the container cannot load. Keep the clone on the Linux
side (`~/Autora`) rather than under `/mnt/c`, and run
`git config core.autocrlf false` there: shell scripts with CRLF line endings
fail with `bad interpreter`.

The **desktop relay** runs on the machine with the screen, so on Windows that
is a Windows process talking out to the Autora container — see
[Controlling a desktop](#controlling-a-desktop).

### Connecting a model

Replies come from whichever provider you connect, called from the server -- the
key never reaches the browser. On a fresh install the chat opens on a card
that asks for one: pick a vendor, paste its key, and Autora checks it before
saving. For the model list and every other option, open **Settings** in the
sidebar:

| Provider | Get a key | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI | <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys> | GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, o3/o4-mini |
| Google Gemini | <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey> | Free tier covers Flash |
| Anthropic Claude | <https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys> | Sonnet, Haiku, Opus |
| DeepSeek | <https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys> | Cheapest of the hosted options |
| OpenRouter | <https://openrouter.ai/keys> | One key, hundreds of models; list and prices fetched live |
| Local server | — | Anything speaking the OpenAI API: vLLM, Ollama, llama.cpp |

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/providers.png" width="820" alt="Providers and models, in Settings: the vendor list, with the key saved for each">
</p>

Each provider keeps its own key, model and endpoint, so switching between them
costs nothing. **Which provider answers** picks one, or leave it on *Automatic*
and the first connected provider is used, in the order shown in the panel.

Every model in the picker is quoted with its price per million tokens, and
those are the same numbers the [billing card](#billing) counts with. **Check
key** asks the vendor whether the key works before you rely on it, and fills
the model list from the same call; **Refresh models** re-asks later, which is
how the OpenRouter catalogue stays current.

OpenRouter routes one model to several providers of its own, so a turn may be
answered by a different one each time -- another machine, at another price.
**Endpoint**, on its row, holds the model chosen above to one of them: the slug
OpenRouter lists for that model (`deepinfra`, `chutes`), with no fallback to the
rest. It belongs to that model alone, so changing the model sends no routing
instruction again, and talk mode's faster model is never held to an endpoint
that does not serve it.

Keys pasted into the panel are saved on the server in `.autora/settings.json`,
created readable only by the account Autora runs as. Keys set in the
environment (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) are still honoured and are never
written to that file -- they are the fallback when the app has no key of its
own, and the panel says which of the two is in force.

Without any key the console still runs -- every panel, the event stream,
memory, approvals and the schedule all work -- but nothing answers, and the
thread says which key is missing rather than improvising a reply.

**[docs/GEMINI.md](docs/GEMINI.md)** covers the Gemini specifics: choosing a
model, the thinking budget, and what each error in the thread means.

### The voice it speaks in

Everything Autora says out loud -- the `v` key, replies read aloud, spoken
approvals -- uses one voice for the whole install. Left alone it is the
browser's own (`speechSynthesis`), which is a different voice on every
device and on most of them the worst one the platform has.

With a Deepgram key it speaks through Deepgram's hosted Aura voices instead:
nothing to run, one request a sentence, and the same voice on the phone, the
laptop and the desktop. Paste the key into **Settings -> Secrets** as
`DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` (or set it in the environment) and that is the whole setup.
**Settings -> Voice** lists the voices the service offers -- the list comes from
the service, so it is whatever it actually has -- plays a sample, remembers the
one picked on every device, and says which service is speaking.

There is one service and one key: Deepgram's hosted voices. A local voice
server is no longer looked for, and a key is the whole of the setup. Which
voice speaks can be changed in **Settings -> Voice**, and the choice is
remembered on every device. When the agent is asked to say something out loud
it uses its `speak` tool, which plays the words on the open page straight
away rather than making an audio file to hand over.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` | Speak through Deepgram's hosted Aura voices. A key saved in Settings -> Secrets wins over this |
| `AUTORA_DEEPGRAM_VOICE` | The Deepgram voice to start with (default `aura-2-thalia-en`); a voice picked in Settings wins |

The page never talks to Deepgram itself. `POST /api/speech` takes a fragment
of text and returns an audio file, which keeps the key on the server and means
a phone on the tailnet needs no route of its own. `POST /api/speech/stream`
takes a whole reply and returns raw 24 kHz PCM as it is rendered, which is what
a narrated answer uses: Deepgram draws the voice fresh for every request -- the
same sentence sent twice comes back at a different pitch and pace -- so a
request per sentence was a voice that changed from sentence to sentence. The
first samples arrive in about half a second and run three or four times faster
than they are spoken, so one rendering for the turn still starts straight away. The audio arrives from the
origin the page already trusts. `GET /api/speech` says whether there is a key,
which voice it would use, and which voices the service has -- the list comes
from Deepgram's own model catalogue, so it is whatever it actually offers.

If there is none -- no key, wrong address, container down -- the panel says so
and the browser's own voice carries on being used. Nothing goes quiet, and
nothing is required to be set up.

### Talking to it

The mark at the left of the composer, or `v`, is talk mode: the strip you type
into becomes the conversation and the thread above it keeps running. It needs a
microphone, which browsers only open on a secure page -- `https`, or
`localhost`.

There is one thing to do, and it is to say the name. **Say "Autora"** and
whatever follows it -- "Autora, what's the weather" -- is the request; say the
name on its own and whatever you say next is. It goes out when you pause: a
sentence that has finished goes about a second later, one that trails off
mid-thought waits longer for you to come back to it. The bar says "Say 'Autora'
to add to the conversation…" while it is listening, and shows the words as they
form once it is yours.

The microphone is open the whole time talk mode is, and everything that is not
the name, at the start of a phrase, is dropped where it stands. That is what
makes talking over an answer work: say the name while Autora is speaking, or
while it is off working, and it stops and the words are yours. It is also how an
open microphone avoids hearing the answer and sending it back as a question --
nothing is listening for anything but its own name.

There is no switch for any of it, and nothing on the bar to press except the X
that takes you back to typing. The camera lives in Settings -> Voice; on, the
picture runs the width of the bar, and the agent is shown about a frame a second
of it.

The month's spend stays over the live bar in talk mode: a spoken turn costs what
a typed one does.

### Tools

A model decides; tools are what it decides *with*. **Settings -> Tools** lists
the five groups, says whether each can actually be used right now, and turns
each on or off:

| Group | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| Terminal | A real shell on the machine Autora runs on, via `bash -lc`. Output streams into the thread as it arrives. |
| Web browser | The Chromium the agent drives: open, read, click, fill, scroll, screenshot. |
| Computer control | Somebody's actual desktop, over [the relay](#controlling-a-desktop). |
| Memory | The workspace graph, which outlives the session. |
| Voice | Saying something out loud on the open page (`speak`), and going quiet when asked. |

None of them asks first by default. A chat whose header is switched from
**Yolo** to **Ask** holds every call that changes something -- or only the
ones matching what you wrote under "ask me when" -- for a yes on a card;
looking is never held.

The same list generates three things that used to be written down separately:
the tool schemas the model receives, the sentence the agent is told about what
it can do, and this panel. They cannot disagree, which is the point -- an agent
that has been told it has a terminal it does not have will narrate command
output rather than admit it, and one told nothing will deny having a shell it
is holding.

A group can be **off** (you turned it off, and the agent is told so) or
**unusable** (on, but the thing it needs is absent -- no Chromium on the
server, no relay dialled in). Those are different sentences, and the agent
gets the one that is true, because "I cannot browse" and "Chromium is not
installed on the server" send you to two very different places.

Nothing waits for approval: every call runs straight away and is shown in the
thread as it happens. Stop kills the whole process group, so `sleep 300` inside a
command dies with the command rather than outliving it.

The agent's own calls are one shell command at a time, with no TTY: `vim`,
`top` and anything that pages will hang rather than work, so it uses
non-interactive flags. Your side of the **Autora Terminal** page is the other
kind: a real terminal -- a live pseudo-terminal with completion, history and
colours, where `vim` and `top` work -- kept per chat. The commands the agent
runs appear in it in a dim colour, the folder you `cd` into is where its next
command starts, and switching the window off takes its terminal tool away.
`sudo` works wherever the account Autora runs as can use it -- in the
Umbrel container that is usually root, where it is unnecessary rather than
unavailable.

The **Tools** page in the sidebar switches the built-in windows, each under
its own name: **Autora Widgets** (`widget_show`), **Autora Browser** (the same
switch as Web browser above), **Autora Creator** where websites and apps are
built (`app_preview`), **Autora Terminal**, **Autora PDF** (the `pdf_*`
tools), **Autora Video**, **Autora Music**, **Autora Pages**, **Autora
Sheets**, **Autora Slides**, **Autora 3D**, **Autora Games** and **Autora
Photo**. All are on by default. One that is off is taken out of the model's
tools from its next step and the agent is told it is off; switching the
Creator window off also closes any that are open.

The **Store** page is where tools made here will be shared with others. It is
not built yet -- the page says so, and nothing else pretends otherwise.

`browser_screenshot` sees the window by default. With `full_page`, `ref`,
`selector` or `area` it takes the whole page, one numbered element, one
element by CSS selector or a rectangle, and with
`save_as` (and `notebook`) it keeps the picture as an artifact -- filed in a
notebook if asked -- so a screenshot can be evidence rather than a glance.

### Integrations (MCP servers)

**Integrations** in the sidebar connects Model Context Protocol servers; their
tools reach the agent as `mcp__<server>__<tool>` from its next step.

You rarely need to go there first. When a task lives on a service with an API --
GitHub, Slack, Notion, a Postgres database, Google Maps, library docs -- and no
connected server covers it, the agent offers one in the conversation instead of
reaching for the browser: a card saying what it is, why it beats clicking
through the website, and exactly what will run. Nothing is installed until you
tap **Set it up**, and **Not now** is remembered for the rest of the session.
Asking "what MCP servers could help with X?" gets an answer from the same list.

- **Keys** a server needs are typed on the card and saved straight to
  Settings › API Keys › Secrets. The server's config only refers to them as
  `${secret:NAME}`, filled in when it starts, so a key never enters the chat,
  the session log or the model's context.
- **Beyond the built-in list**, the agent can offer any MCP server published on
  npm (run with `npx -y`), a remote one at a URL, or **one it writes itself**:
  a few tools, each a short piece of JavaScript, generated into a real stdio
  server under the settings directory (`mcp-servers/`).
- **A launcher that downloads a binary for the platform** is given the build
  for *this* machine before it starts, fetched once into the data directory
  rather than a cache a container update wipes. webclaw's launcher has no musl
  entry, so on an Alpine container it used to fetch a glibc build it could not
  run and the only symptom was `MCP error -32000: Connection closed`.

Servers the agent set up are marked *set up by Autora* on the Integrations
page, where they can be edited, switched off or removed like any other.

The page also has a **Suggested for you** card, for the times you go looking
rather than being offered one in a conversation. It is deliberately quiet and
easy to satisfy: a server is suggested either because this install already
holds the key it wants — paste a GitHub token anywhere and the GitHub server
is a fact about the install rather than a guess — or because a word from its
list appears in your standing instructions or in the titles of your recent
chats. Nothing is installed by looking at the card, the line under each one
says which of the two it was, and no suggestions at all is a normal state of
affairs: a list padded to look helpful would be worse than an empty one.

### Billing

Settings carries a billing card: this month, today, and all time, with a
thirty-day chart and a breakdown by provider and model down to individual
turns. It is counted locally -- every turn records the tokens the vendor
reported and prices them from the table the model picker quoted -- so it is an
accurate running estimate, not an invoice. It cannot see usage from outside
this app, nor a vendor's own discounts, cache credits or minimums, and a turn
whose vendor reported no token count is marked as estimated rather than
silently averaged in.

An optional monthly budget draws a meter and warns as it fills. It does not
block: a console that stops answering mid-sentence because of a number typed
weeks ago is a worse surprise than the bill it was meant to prevent.

### Running fully local

```bash
# any OpenAI-compatible server: vLLM, Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio
AUTORA_LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1 npm run dev
```

Then pick **Local server** in Settings and type the model's name
(`qwen3-coder`, say). The address can be set there too, which wins over the
variable.

### Reaching it from a phone

Autora speaks plain HTTP, which is fine over `localhost` and fine for
reading the thread from another device. Two things need more than that:

| Wants a secure page | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Install to the home screen | Browsers only install a PWA from an https origin |
| Dictation and live voice chat | Microphone capture is gated on a secure context |

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/mobile.png" width="300" alt="The same session on a phone: a single column, with the work in it">
</p>

A private network is not enough — `http://box.tailnet.ts.net:8817` is an
insecure origin as far as the browser is concerned, and no amount of site
settings changes that.

**On a tailnet, this is one command and it is the best answer there is.**
Tailscale issues a real certificate, so there is no warning to click through,
and whatever was guarding the plain port — Umbrel's login, say — still guards
it. On the machine running Autora:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg --https=8443 8817   # https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8443 -> :8817
tailscale serve status                   # confirm, and see the URL to open
tailscale serve --https=8443 off         # undo
```

**Not on 443.** Plain `tailscale serve --bg 8817` serves on 443, and on an
Umbrel that takes the port umbrelOS 2.0 needs for its own HTTPS dashboard:
umbreld then fails at boot with `EADDRINUSE ... :::443` and restarts in a loop,
and the whole box is unreachable. If that has happened, free the port with
`tailscale serve --https=443 off` and start Umbrel again
(`sudo systemctl start umbrel`).

Open the `https://` URL it prints, port and all, and the microphone,
the install prompt and everything else appear. It needs MagicDNS and HTTPS
Certificates enabled for the tailnet, both in the admin console under **DNS**;
`tailscale serve` will tell you if they are off. With a proxy in front you can
also drop `--host 0.0.0.0` and go back to the default `127.0.0.1` bind, so
nothing has to listen on the tailnet interface at all.

Anything else that terminates TLS works the same way: Caddy or nginx with a
certificate from `tailscale cert`, or whatever reverse proxy you already run.

**With nothing in front of it**, `AUTORA_TLS=1` is the fallback. Autora puts an
https listener on the next port up with a certificate it generates and keeps:

```bash
AUTORA_TLS=1 AUTORA_HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start   # http on 3000, https on 3001
```

Nothing moves — the plain port serves what it always did, and the http page
offers a link across.

That certificate is signed by a small authority Autora generates and keeps, and
the authority is offered for download at `/autora-ca.crt` (Settings → **Trust
this server** has it, with the steps for Android and iPhone). Install it on a
device and the warning stops, the microphone works, and the page installs to
the home screen as a real app — three complaints that are one fact underneath:
nothing on that device had vouched for the certificate. Leaves are issued per
hostname during the handshake, from the name the browser asks for, so reaching
the box by tailnet name, `.local` or bare IP all match.

Install it only on devices you own: an authority you trust can vouch for any
site to that device, and this one is worth exactly what the server holding its
key is. Skipping it costs nothing but the warning — clicking through still
opens the microphone, it just will not install to a home screen.

The listener itself has whatever authentication Autora has, which is none. That
is fine on a network you control and a poor thing to expose anywhere else,
which is why it is off by default in the Umbrel app (`AUTORA_TLS=1` to turn it
on) and why a real certificate in front is better still.

Until then the microphone and `Live` are still in the composer, greyed, and
tapping either says what is in the way and offers the secure page if one is
running — rather than vanishing and leaving you to conclude voice was never
built.

| Env | |
| --- | --- |
| `AUTORA_TLS=1` | Also serve https, with a generated certificate |
| `AUTORA_TLS_PORT` | Where (default: `AUTORA_PORT` + 1) |
| `AUTORA_TLS_CERT` / `AUTORA_TLS_KEY` | Use a real certificate instead |
| `AUTORA_TLS_NAMES` | Extra names or addresses for a browser that connects by bare IP (which names no host, so gets the certificate listing this machine's own addresses) |

The Umbrel app publishes 8818 for this and ships with `AUTORA_TLS: "0"`. Put a
proxy in front if you can; set it to `1` if you cannot.

#### Install it to the home screen

Once the page is on **https** — the tailnet URL above, or a certificate from
`/autora-ca.crt` — the browser will install it as an app, and it is worth
doing: it opens without the browser's chrome, it gets its own icon and
switcher entry, and the session list, the thread and the composer use the
whole screen.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Android** (Chrome, Edge) | Menu (⋮) → **Add to Home screen** → **Install**. Or the banner Autora shows when it sees an install prompt available. |
| **iPhone / iPad** (Safari) | Share → **Add to Home Screen**. iOS ignores the manifest's display mode, so installing is the only way to lose the browser bars. |
| **Desktop** (Chrome, Edge) | The install icon in the address bar, or menu → **Install Autora**. |

What it installs is `public/manifest.webmanifest` — standalone display,
portrait-friendly, icons at 192, 512 and a maskable 512 for Android's adaptive
shapes — plus the service worker in `public/sw.js`, which serves the app's
shell from cache so it opens instantly and does not show a browser error page
when the server is briefly away.

An installed copy is a copy: it keeps working while the server is down, which
also means it does not notice an update until it asks for one. Autora checks
`/api/system` and says so in a bar at the top when the version on screen is
behind the one being served — including a **Reload** button, and the service
worker calls `skipWaiting` so the reload actually lands on the new build
rather than the cached one.

### Controlling a desktop

Autora can drive a real computer's screen — click, type, scroll — through a
small relay that runs on that computer. The relay connects *out* to Autora, so
nothing has to be opened up on the machine with the screen, and it is a single
file with no Autora imports, so that machine does not need Autora installed.

Get it from the server you want it to reach, which fills the address in for
you:

```bash
# on the machine you want the agent to control
curl -O http://YOUR-SERVER:8817/relay.py      # Windows: curl.exe -O ...
pip install websockets mss pyautogui pillow   # Windows: py -m pip install ...
python relay.py                               # Windows: py relay.py
```

**Settings → Desktop relay** in the UI has those same three commands with your
server's own address already in them, says whether a relay is connected, and
lists what to check when one will not connect.

`python relay.py 192.168.1.5:8817` points it at a different address; any form
works — `host:port`, `http://host:port`, `ws://host`. Over https with Autora's
own certificate, the relay needs `--insecure` or the certificate from
`/autora-ca.crt` installed on that machine.

One thing catches people out: outside the container Autora listens on
`127.0.0.1` unless told otherwise, so start it with `AUTORA_HOST=0.0.0.0` if
the relay is on another machine.

Frames reach the conversation only while a session is using the desktop; a
connected but idle relay is not an hour of screenshots in your transcript. The
live preview in Settings tells you it is alive in the meantime.

macOS needs Accessibility permission for the terminal you run it from (System
Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility) — capture works without it,
clicking and typing do not. Linux needs an X display, so install XWayland under
Wayland. Windows needs nothing special.

### Other commands

```bash
curl localhost:3000/api/sessions                  # list recordings
curl localhost:3000/api/sessions/<id>/events      # one session's events, as JSON
```

Each session's full log is also on disk as `sessions/<id>/events.jsonl` under
the state directory, one event per line.

## What you see

One column: the conversation, with the work inside it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/session-live.png" width="880" alt="A session settled: the answer, the command it ran and the page it read, each at the point it happened">
</p>

| In the thread | Shows |
|---|---|
| **A command** | The shell call where the agent ran it, its own output under it, colours and progress bars intact, with the exit code and how long it took. |
| **A page** | The page itself, live, while it is open: you watch the pointer travel and the clicks land. Once it has moved on, every frame of that stretch stays with the card, with a marker painted where each click went — drag its strip to move through them. The *agent* reads the page as text, not pixels — see below. |
| **A desktop** | The same, for the machine the relay is running on. |
| **An image** | Drawn in the conversation, at a size you can read and one tap from full screen — a screenshot it was asked for, a chart it made, or a picture it wrote into a sentence. |
| **An edit** | The unified diff, the moment it lands. |
| **Everything else** | One line each — a lookup, a read, a memory write — openable for the detail. |

Nothing is hidden behind a tab, and nothing scrolls away: the terminal from
three questions ago is still three questions up, next to the question that
caused it. Reviewing a session is scrolling back through it, which is also how
you review the session someone else ran — there is no separate recording mode
to enter, because the transcript *is* the recording.

The interface is dark, keyboard-friendly, and has no third-party dependencies at
runtime — fonts are vendored (Inter and JetBrains Mono, variable, Latin subset,
77KB total), so it works offline and on an airgapped box, and opening a session
does not tell a CDN about it.

It is one app at every size. On a phone it is a single column with the
conversation and a tab for scheduled tasks. On a desktop the session list comes
out into a rail on the left, the reading column widens, and screenshots and
diffs get room to be read at a useful size rather than shrunk into a pane.

| Key | |
|---|---|
| `/` | focus the composer |
| `k` | the knowledge web |
| `v` | live voice chat |
| `esc` | close whatever is open |

Every row in the session list carries a dot: green with a halo while that chat
is working, plain green when it only has a window open on it, and amber when it
is over -- nothing running and nothing holding it open.

The tab itself carries state: the favicon and title go violet while the agent
works, amber when it is waiting on your approval. An approval that lands while
the tab is in the background also chimes once.

## The windows beside the chat

The conversation is one column; the work opens in windows beside it. On a
desktop each is a tab -- one window shown at a time, the rest staying open and
running, closed with the x on their tab. On a phone the window you are working
in appears inside the chat, full screen, with a chat button in the top bar to
come back. A window opens by itself the first time its work needs it.

In every one of them you can work on the same thing at the same time: what you
change reaches the agent on its next look, and what it changes is drawn for
you as it happens. The windows are named on the Tools page (below); each has
its own section in this chapter, and they all wear one shared tool bar
(described under [The tool rail](#the-tool-rail)).

## How the agent sees a page

Not by screenshot. `read` returns every interactive element on the page with
the role and name a screen reader would announce it by, numbered:

```
[0] textbox "Email address" value="ada@example.com"
[1] textbox "Password" password empty
[4] checkbox "Remember me" checked
[7] button "Sign in"
[9] link "Terms of service" -> /tos
```

Actions take those numbers: `click(ref=7)`, and `fill` takes a list, so a whole
form is one round trip instead of one per field. Every action returns a freshly
numbered page, so acting rarely needs a `read` first — and refs cannot go stale
without saying so, because a ref that quietly pointed somewhere else is how an
agent ends up clicking the wrong button.

The accessibility tree rather than the DOM, because the DOM is wrapper soup: a
button is six nested divs, and `innerText` cannot see a form field at all. The
a11y layer is what the platform already computes for perceiving an interface
without looking at it. That sign-in page above is ~110 tokens. A 1280×800
screenshot of it is ~1,300, and you cannot click it.

Screenshots remain, as the fallback they should be: for questions about how a
page *looks* — a chart, a canvas, a broken layout. The human still gets the full
video feed either way; the screencast is a separate channel from what the model
reads.

Name an address in a message and a real Chromium opens it. A bare domain needs
a verb in front of it — `open example.com`, not every passing mention of
`npm.io` — because launching a browser should be something you can point at
afterwards and say why it happened.

### Watching it work

Reading a page as text is what makes an agent good at browsing. Not being able
to see what it did is what makes it impossible to trust. So the two are
separate channels out of the same page, and you get both:

- **The model gets text.** The numbered outline above, and the page's readable
  prose. No pixels.
- **You get video.** Chrome's own screencast, frame by frame over the session
  socket, at six frames a second by default.

The pointer is real. Before a click, it travels to the target and a ring plays
where it lands — drawn into the page inside a shadow root so the page cannot
restyle it and it never appears in what the agent reads — and then the click is
dispatched as an ordinary mouse event at those coordinates. The agent is not
miming for the camera; it is clicking there, and the camera is pointed at it.

The feed is deliberately not part of the record. Frames go out over the socket
and are never written to the event log: a browsing session would otherwise be a
video file in the transcript, replayed in full to every tab that reconnects.
What the log keeps is keyframes — one after each navigation and each action —
which is what the card shows once the page has moved on. The card says
**watching** while frames are arriving and **back to live** once you have
scrolled back through them.

Nothing is encoded while nobody is looking: the stream stops when the last tab
closes and a fresh tab is handed one frame immediately, because a page sitting
still emits none of its own.

| | |
|---|---|
| `open <url>` | Go there. |
| `click(ref)` | Click the numbered element, visibly. |
| `fill([{ref, text}], submit)` | A whole form in one round trip. |
| `scroll(dy)` · `back()` · `read()` | The rest of it. |
| `shot()` | A picture of the page, into the conversation. |

The same calls are on `POST /api/sessions/:id/browser`, so a person can drive
the page too — which is what turns the card from a recording into something you
can take over.

### Pointing at things

Describing an element in prose and hoping the agent finds the same one is the
slow way to ask for a change; pointing at it is not. In the app window (below)
that is **Select**.

A pick resolves what you actually meant — point at the label inside a button and
you get the button — and comes back with a stable selector, and only the styles *that element* sets, not the whole inherited
cascade. Where the framework left a trail (React's dev fiber, a `data-source`
attribute) it resolves to the file and line that rendered it; where it did not,
it says so rather than guessing at a file. The pick lands in the thread like any
other event: the agent sees that you pointed and at what.

### The app window

When the agent builds a website or an app it starts it in the **app window**
(`app_preview`): a second browser per chat, beside the conversation on a wide
screen and a tab in the pinned view on a phone. A dev server it runs (its
address read from what it prints, https and base path included), a folder of
files it serves (reloaded by itself as the files change), or something already
running on this machine -- never another site. You see it take shape, at a
phone, tablet or desktop size, under its own back button, reload and address
bar (a path like `/about` goes to that page of the app).

Three tools on the page: **Use** (click, type, drag and scroll it as normal; a
dropdown's choices are listed over the page, since its own popup never reaches
the picture), **Select** (hover outlines, a click picks an element; the arrow
keys step outwards, inwards and sideways; shift adds more; the box can try a
change right on the page -- retype the text, set a colour, a size, a corner,
spacing -- and the change goes with the comment as before and after; a change
tried and then cancelled is put back) and **Region** (drag a box round
anything). Each comment is kept with a picture, pinned where it was made, and
they go together as one **review**: one message to the agent, with a picture of
each and, for every element, a unique selector, its words and styles, where it
sits, and the component and file when the framework says. Comments not yet sent
survive the agent restarting the window, and so does the size you picked.

The bar counts the page's console errors; tap the count to read them -- the
agent sees the same lines. If the dev server the window was started with exits,
the window says so, with the last thing it printed. The agent can `look` at the
page and its console to check its own work, and may do so while it is still
planning: looking changes nothing.

### PDFs

Attach a PDF (or name one on the server) and ask for what you want done to it.
Seven tools, always on, do what [SecurePDF](https://github.com/blofstedt/SecurePDF)
does in its editor, asked for in words instead:

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pdf_read` | Pages and sizes, properties, form fields (with their choices and where each one is), attachments, and the text page by page. `find` searches instead, for words, a `/regex/` or the presets `email`, `phone`, `ssn`, `credit_card` and `date`, and says where each match is. `extract` saves embedded files, or an XFA form's XML. |
| `pdf_look` | Pages as pictures, for the agent and in the thread: a scan read, an edit checked. `grid` rules the page in points, which is how the agent finds where to put things; `area` zooms in. |
| `pdf_edit` | Fill form fields by name, flatten the form, and draw on pages: text, stamps (APPROVED, REJECTED, SIGN HERE, DATE, CONFIDENTIAL...), a signature (a picture, or a typed name in a handwriting font), images, ticks and crosses, boxes, circles, lines, arrows, highlights (a box, or wherever some words are) and comments. Also a watermark, page numbers, and the document's properties, set or stripped. |
| `pdf_compose` | Write a new PDF from a description of the document: headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, quotes, code and pictures, laid out onto pages with page numbers and a numbered list of the sources cited. The description is kept, so when new findings come in the agent updates, inserts or removes blocks by id and the whole document is laid out again, instead of repositioning anything. `pdf_edit` then marks it up on top. |
| `pdf_pages` | Keep, drop, reorder, repeat and turn pages, add blank ones, merge other PDFs in, or split into several files. |
| `pdf_redact` | Take words, patterns or boxes out for good. The pages concerned are redrawn as pictures with black boxes, so what was under them is gone from the file rather than covered; the rest keep their text. |
| `pdf_compress` | Rewrite it compactly, or redraw every page as a JPEG for a much smaller scan. Nothing is saved if it would not get smaller. |

Every result is a new file, shown in the thread to open or download; your own
file is never overwritten. A password-protected PDF opens with its password
(the agent asks for it), and what comes out is not protected -- the tools do
not add passwords. Positions are points from the top-left of the page as you
see it, whatever rotation or crop the file has underneath, so what `pdf_read`
reports, the `pdf_look` grid shows and `pdf_edit` takes are the same numbers.
Dropped and redacted pages are removed from the bytes, not just from view.

Dynamic XFA forms -- the ones most viewers only answer with "please wait" --
are read and drawn, and their filled-in data is listed, but they cannot be
filled here; `pdf_compress` with `mode: images` turns one into an ordinary PDF
of how it looks. The built-in fonts write Western European text; `pdf_edit`
refuses other scripts rather than writing question marks, and `pdf_compose`
writes the common ones another way (`->` for an arrow) and says which characters
it had to replace with `?`.

Pages are drawn, and text is read, by pdf.js in a headless Chromium -- the
same binary the browser tool uses. Without one, the tools still read a file's
properties and fields, fill it, draw on it, rearrange it and rewrite it
compactly, but cannot read its text, show its pages, find where words are,
type a signature, redact, or redraw pages as pictures.

### Games

Ask for a game and a window opens beside the chat with [GDevelop](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop)'s
open-source editor in it (MIT; its name and logo are its author's), working on the game of that chat.
GDevelop's own AI, account, shop and cloud are taken out: Autora is what helps. The game is the
project file GDevelop itself saves, so the editor and the agent are working on the same thing.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `game_open` | Opens the window on the chat's game (an empty one with a scene the first time) and says what is in it. |
| `game_look` | Reads the game: the overview, a scene, one object, a scene's events as lines (each with the path that finds it), where instances are placed, the resources, or any part of the file by path. |
| `game_edit` | Changes it: `set`, `insert`, `remove` and `merge` at a path such as `layouts[Scene].objects[Player].behaviors`, all together or not at all. The reply lists what looks wrong. |
| `game_check` | Checks the whole game: instructions the engine does not have or with the wrong number of parameters, instances of objects that do not exist, pictures missing from the resources. |
| `game_catalog` | Looks up the engine's own list of actions, conditions, expressions, objects and behaviors, with the exact type and the order of the parameters. |
| `game_template` | The shape of a new scene, object, behavior, instance, resource or event, as the editor saves it. |
| `game_import` | Adds a picture, sound, font, video or 3D model (an artifact or a file) to the game's resources. |

You can change anything by hand while it works, and what you do is saved a moment later; the agent's next
look sees it. Preview runs the game in a box of its own (it has no access to Autora), and Share exports it
as a web game (a .zip). The idea, the story, the look and the feel stay yours: the agent does the wiring and
asks about the rest. The editor may connect to Autora and nowhere else, so GDevelop's asset store, examples
and online services are not reachable; bring pictures and sound from your own files or with `game_import`.
The editor is built into the image from a pinned commit of GDevelop (`gdevelop/PIN.json`).

### Video

Ask for a video and a window opens beside the chat with
[OpenCut](https://github.com/opencut-app/opencut-classic)'s editor in it,
working on the
project of that chat: a timeline of tracks and clips. Import your footage,
pictures and music (or point the agent at a file), and it builds the cut with
the editor's own actions, one at a time, each one undoable with Ctrl+Z -- add
and trim clips, split at the playhead, titles and subtitles, stickers,
effects, masks, keyframes, speed changes, audio separated onto its own track.
You watch the timeline change and can take the editor over at any moment; the
agent re-reads the timeline before it relies on what it saw.

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `video_open` / `video_look` | Open the window and read the project: size, frame rate, the media, every track and clip with its times. |
| `video_import` | Bring a video, audio or image file into the project's media (an artifact or a path on this machine). |
| `video_edit` | The timeline, one step at a time: add clips, text, stickers, graphics, effect layers and subtitle tracks; split, trim, move, delete, duplicate; change a clip's properties; seek, play, undo and redo. |
| `video_style` | How a clip looks, sounds and moves: effects, masks, keyframes (position, scale, rotation, opacity, volume, colour), speed, audio separation. |
| `video_project` | Around the clips: tracks, scenes, bookmarks, size and frame rate, and the editor's own panels and keyboard actions. |
| `video_ui` | The editor's screen itself, for anything the typed tools do not cover: every button, menu and slider, clicked and typed as a person would. |
| `video_catalog` | What there is to choose from -- effects, masks, graphics, stickers, a clip's own properties -- so nothing is guessed. |
| `video_frame` | A picture of one moment as the editor will export it, to check a cut or a title instead of trusting the numbers. |
| `video_export` | Render the project to a video file in the thread. It can take a while for a long cut, and only runs when you ask for a file. |

The story, the pacing, the music and the look stay yours: the agent asks and
suggests, and does the technical work completely. Exported files are capped at
50 MB; lower the quality for a longer video.

### Music

Ask for music and a window opens beside the chat: a small studio. A song has
a tempo, a key and scale, and tracks -- keys, synth, bass, pluck, pad, lead,
or a drum kit -- with a mixer (volume, pan, reverb, mute, solo). Clips sit on
the tracks and hold the notes, beat by beat. You have a piano roll, the
arrangement and the mixer, and you edit the same song the agent is working on.

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `studio_open` / `studio_look` | Open the window and read the song: tempo, key, every track and clip, and a few honest observations (a clip with no notes, notes outside the key, no bass). It also says which clip you have open, so "this clip" means something. |
| `studio_song` | The song as a whole: name, tempo, key, beats per bar, length, master volume, loop. |
| `studio_track` | Tracks and the mixer: add, change, duplicate, clear, remove. |
| `studio_clip` | The blocks that hold notes: add, move, resize, rename, duplicate, split, remove. |
| `studio_notes` | The notes inside a clip: add, replace, clear, remove, transpose, quantise, humanise, velocity. |
| `studio_make` | A backing part in one step: chords from a progression, a bass line that follows them, or a drum beat in one of the house styles. |
| `studio_play` / `studio_export` | Play the song in your window; bounce it to a stereo WAV when you ask for a file. |

The agent cannot hear the music -- its checks are what `studio_look` reports
-- so how it sounds is your word. The tune you are writing is yours: it helps
with the backing and the editing, and writes a melody only when you ask it to.

### 3D

Ask for a model and a window opens beside the chat: a modeller built from
simple shapes. A shape is a flat outline pushed up to a height, in
millimetres -- a box, a cylinder, a polygon, or a sketch of your own -- and
everything else is done to those: cut holes and pockets, bevel edges round or
flat, push and pull faces, repeat a shape along a path or around a circle,
join and subtract shapes, and keep reusable parts in a library. Groups
select, move and turn together.

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `cad_scene_get` | Every shape with its id, name, size, position, material and group. The first call of any job. |
| `cad_shape_add` / `cad_shape_draw` / `cad_shape_cut` | Add a stock shape; sketch an outline and extrude it; cut a hole or pocket into one. |
| `cad_shape_set` / `cad_shape_move` / `cad_shape_turn` / `cad_shape_resize` | Change, move, turn and resize shapes. |
| `cad_face_set` / `cad_face_push` / `cad_edge_bevel` | Type a number for a face, push or pull it, bevel its edges. |
| `cad_shapes_join` / `cad_shapes_subtract` | Unite overlapping shapes into one solid; cut cutters out of them. |
| `cad_repeat_set` | Live repeats: copies equally spaced along a path or around a circle, which follow the shape when it is edited. |
| `cad_group_*` / `cad_library_*` | Groups, and the project library of reusable objects, placed as linked copies. |
| `cad_shape_measure` | Build the real solid and report its volume, area and whether it is watertight -- printable. |
| `cad_export` | The visible shapes as an STL to print, a GLB for game engines, an OBJ or the document as JSON. |

You push, pull and move the same model by hand, so the agent re-reads the
scene before it relies on what it saw. What to make and how it looks are
yours; the geometry is its. A part is checked with `cad_shape_measure` before
it is called printable.

### Photo

Ask for a picture to be edited and a window opens beside the chat with
PhotoCraft's editor in it: layers, masks, adjustment layers, layer styles,
type, brushes, filters and real PSD files, kept layered. The chat has one
picture; you paint and edit by hand while the agent works, and what you change
reaches it a moment after you stop.

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `photo_open` | Put a picture in the window (an image, a PSD or a PhotoCraft file), or start a blank canvas. |
| `photo_look` | The picture as it is now, flattened, as an image -- after a change, before it is called done. |
| `photo_info` | Its size, colour mode and the whole layer tree: names, kinds, visibility, opacity, blend modes, masks, adjustments. |
| `photo_commands` | Every menu item, tool and dialog is a command with an id such as `filter.blur.gaussianBlur`; this finds them by name, with their parameters. |
| `photo_edit` | Run commands in order; each one is an undo step for you. |
| `photo_export` | Save the picture as png, jpg, webp, tif, psd (layered) or PhotoCraft's own format. |

The technical work -- resizing, cropping, masks, cut-outs, exports, colour
management -- is the agent's; the look, the mood and what the picture is of
are yours. Command ids are looked up, never guessed.

### The tool rail

Every tool window wears one shared tool bar: round, coloured buttons down
the right side on a desktop and along the bottom on a phone, showing only as
many as fit and never scrolling. The last button, **All tools**, opens every
tool the app has in a centred grid, grouped the way the app groups them; on a
desktop any tool can be pinned to the bar ("The bar is full" when it cannot;
**Reset bar** puts the defaults back; pins are kept per app on that device).
The open tool's settings are one compact tray beside the bar, in the tool's
own colour.

Colours are by verb, not by app, so a person learns them once: select blue,
text emerald, draw purple, shapes indigo, delete and redact rose, sign and
insert cyan. The rail is built into each app where it can be -- OpenCut,
GDevelop and the office editors as forks, Photo in its own Rust build -- so it
looks the same everywhere and each app's own commands run underneath it. What
it replaced went in the same change: Music's toolbar rows and tab strip,
Video's icon strip and timeline toolbar, the office editors' ribbon and phone
"More" button, 3D's bottom bar of text pills, Photo's menu bar, toolbox and
panel dock.

The rail is a view, not a second mode: the agent has every tool through its
own tools whatever the bar shows, and each window's manual (what the agent is
told when it first touches a window) describes the bar as you see it, so it
points you at a tool by name and says "open All tools" when it is not on your
bar. The design and the audit that drove it are in
[docs/TOOL-RAIL.md](docs/TOOL-RAIL.md) and
[docs/TOOL-RAIL-AUDIT.md](docs/TOOL-RAIL-AUDIT.md).

### Pages, Sheets and Slides

The office suite: three editors of your own, each with its window beside the
chat. **Autora Pages** is a word processor for .docx files, **Autora Sheets**
a spreadsheet for .xlsx (formulas recalculated in the file, charts) and
**Autora Slides** a deck editor for .pptx. Someone who says Word, Excel,
PowerPoint or Google Docs means these.

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `office_guide` | The operations an editor of a kind takes, with their exact names and fields -- read before the first edit of a kind. |
| `office_create` | Make a new file from Markdown, HTML, rows of cells or a deck spec. |
| `office_read` | Read it as saved: a document's blocks, a sheet's cells with their formulas, a slide's elements with their ids and positions. |
| `office_edit` | Change it with operations, targeted by the ids `office_read` shows; formulas are recalculated and the results are in the file. Tracked changes are kept for you to accept or reject. |
| `office_check` | Look it over for problems: formula errors, references to sheets that are not there, columns too narrow, text that overflows its box, a stale table of contents. |
| `office_look` | The pages as they lay out, as pictures -- after a build or a change, before it is called done. |
| `office_open` | Open a file that already exists in its editor, for you to read and change while the agent works. |
| `office_pdf` / `office_convert` | A PDF of a document, laid out by its own editor; conversions between formats that need no page layout. |

Only what is edited is rewritten; the rest of the file survives byte for
byte, and every change is a new artifact beside the original. The words of a
story or a speech you are writing are yours; layout, formulas, formatting and
structure are the agent's.

## The Organization

Autora starts as one agent -- the lead, whatever answers in the chat. On the
**Organization** page you add others beside it, each with a human name, a job
title, what it is told to be and do, and a line on when it should be called: a
researcher, an editor, a bookkeeper, whoever the work needs. The page draws
the chart of them -- Teams-style person cards, rounded connectors, a team
folded away behind its manager's pill -- and each agent carries its own colour
and its own mark, drawn at random and never the same as another's.

Each agent has a **mind of its own**: a separate memory graph, kept apart from
the lead's, so a specialist is not confused by everything else the lead knows.
The lead can see where its own memory clusters by subject and hand a whole
domain to a specialist; it can also hire a new agent for a kind of work that
keeps coming up, edit one, merge two that overlap, move one under a different
manager, or remove one. Personality and attributes (warmth, rigour, humour and
the rest) are drawn for a new agent and grow by themselves as it works with the
others.

The lead is given the map every turn and does the routing: when a piece of
work matches an agent's "call it when", it starts that agent with the `agents`
tool and lets it run to the end. A run is a session of its own with its own
log, but it is not one of your chats -- it reports into the conversation that
called it, the agent announcing itself when it starts and reporting back when
it finishes. Nothing follows on by itself: a report comes back to the lead and
the work stops there, so every agent after the first is a decision made run by
run rather than a chain nobody asked for. Such runs are kept out of the
session list entirely: they are the agent's work, not your chats.

You can call one yourself: type **@** in the message box and the Organization
is offered as you type. A mention is a hand-off -- the named agent's part of
the message is put in front of it -- not a shout into the room.

While an agent works, you see it work: the labelled cursor that moves in every
window is that agent's -- its name on the tag, its colour on the pointer and
the ring, the shape of its mark beside the name -- in the browser, the
terminal, and every editor. In the terminal its command is typed in key by key
at a person's pace, then runs.

### Threads

**Threads** is the agents' own corner of the app -- a forum, outside the work
in hand. They post under their own names, comment on each other's posts, and
like what they think deserves it; you can post too, and a remark of yours with
nobody named is put to the room for any of them to answer. They bring news
from the web, show their work in the open, and use emoji and GIFs like anyone
with a keyboard.

How much they talk is a setting (**Let the agents talk in Threads**, in
Settings): with two or more agents on, one now and then posts, answers another
or you, or likes something -- each utterance a small model call. An agent left
idle starts threads after a long silence and keeps things it is curious about.
New posts and finished tasks reach your phone as notifications. Nothing here
is where work you asked for is reported: a session doing a task handed to it
can read Threads but not post to it, and the report goes back where the work
came from.

### Notebooks

A notebook groups artifacts by purpose -- a case, a report, a project -- in
order, with notes between them. Each entry is either a file (with a caption
and a note on what it shows) or a note in Markdown that can cite the files it
rests on. Make them on the **Notebooks** page, or file a selection from
**Artifacts** with *Add to notebook*.

The agent has the same with the `notebook` tool (list, create, read, add,
edit, remove, move, export), and `notebook=` on `artifact_save` and
`browser_screenshot` files what it makes as it goes. Asked to compile
something -- a report from a set of emails, a rebuttal of a document with
proof -- it files every source with what it shows, writes each finding as a
note citing its evidence, and reads the notebook back to check nothing is
missing before it says it is done.

The notebook button beside the message box adds notebooks or saved files to
a message. The agent is given an index of each notebook (every entry, notes
to their first line) and reads the rest with `notebook read`. **Export**
downloads a notebook as one Markdown document, its files as numbered
exhibits. A file in a notebook is never cleared away by retention; deleting
it from Artifacts takes it out of every notebook, and deleting a notebook
leaves its files.

## Approvals

Autora runs without approval gates by default: a call runs straight away and
is shown in the thread as it happens, and Stop kills whatever is running. There
are two ways to put a gate back, and they are about different things.

**The chat's permissions** — in the header of the conversation, and saved
with it. *Yolo* is the default. *Ask* lets the agent look freely and holds
anything that writes, runs or sends for your yes -- all of it, or only what you
name: write when it should ask ("before deleting anything, before sending a
message") or tap a suggestion, and each call is read against your words. See
[`server/modes.ts`](server/modes.ts) for what counts as looking and what
counts as changing — the list is short and deliberate, and a tool that is not
on it is treated as a change.

**How the agent works** is a separate choice, in the message box: *Build*
does the work straight away, *Plan* is read-only -- it looks,
researches and writes its plan on the to-do list, and changes are refused --
and *Agent* (the default) plans first, then switches itself to build, and back if the plan
needs rethinking. Only a very simple task skips the plan. The switches show in
the thread; the selector stays on Agent.

The to-do list is where you watch that plan happen. An item can carry the
steps it is made of, shown under it on the card, each optionally naming the
agent it was handed to; the agent ticks and strikes them one at a time as it
goes. The bar under the message box counts the credit left in the account as
the work spends it.

The rail keeps a memory card at its foot: the record the agent most recently
recalled, with the buttons to keep it or throw it away. Tapping the card opens
the memory itself; **Open the Mind** in its foot takes you to the graph.

**The per-group setting** — Settings → **Tools**, one approval mode for each of
terminal, browser, computer and memory. `never` (the default) asks nothing;
`risky` asks only about calls that change something; `always` asks about every
call in the group. Since 0.9.95 this setting is obeyed rather than only stored
— until then `needsApproval` in [`server/tools.ts`](server/tools.ts) returned
false whatever it said — so an install that set `always` and saw nothing happen
will now be asked.

Both of those are about the ordinary work of a turn, and neither touches what
comes next. Whatever the mode or the setting says, the guard's standing
agreements decide the calls it was taught, and the irrecoverable tier — a
format, a recursive delete of everything, a force-push over main — stops and
asks every single time. A mode cannot be granted by the agent: it is set by you,
on the chat, and the agent is told what it is.

## Context

The model's context is a projection of the event log, the same way the UI is —
`compose(events)` in `src/autora/context.py` folds the log into messages, so
there is no second history to drift out of sync, and "what was in context at
step 12" has an answer.

That projection is where the cost lives. Two things it does:

**Caches the conversation prefix.** The system prompt and tools were already
cached; the history was not, so a forty-step turn re-sent an ever-growing
conversation as fresh input on every step. A breakpoint on the tail means each
turn is paid for once instead of once per remaining iteration.

**Trims old tool output.** A 4000-line test run matters while the agent is
acting on it and not ten steps later, so old results are demoted to a preview
plus a pointer. The full text stays in the blob store — `recall(ref=…)` reads it
back, and `recall(ref=…, search="…")` greps it. Lossy in context, lossless on
disk.

Compaction is batched and sticky rather than continuous, because rewriting
history invalidates the cached prefix from the rewrite point on. Nothing is
trimmed until the window crosses `trigger_tokens`; between compactions the
context is strictly append-only.

On a 30-step turn with 3KB of output per step, measured with
`estimate_tokens`:

| | final request | turn total |
|---|---:|---:|
| Before | 18,633 | 288,880 |
| After | 6,052 | 136,460 |

Applying Anthropic's published cache multipliers to those counts puts the turn
at roughly `0.8×` the cost of a single uncached send of its final request, down
from `15.5×` — most of it from the breakpoint, not the trimming. Real billing
depends on actual cache hits; check `usage.cached` in the UI. Tuning lives in
`ContextPolicy`.

## Memory

The agent keeps what it learns in `~/.autora/memory.db` — one SQLite file, no
service, openable with any SQLite client. Four kinds of record: **preferences**
(how you want things done), **procedures** (a how-to that worked — a skill, once
you stop capitalising it), **facts**, and **episodes** (a notable outcome worth
recalling).

Two rules keep it from rotting:

**Everything has provenance.** A record points back at the session and event
that produced it. A memory system without that becomes a junk drawer — claims
accumulate and a wrong one is indistinguishable from a right one. Being able to
ask "why do you think that?" and delete the answer is what makes the rest
trustworthy.

**Nothing is confirmed on first sight.** Records written automatically land
`provisional`, and are promoted only when a later session independently writes
the same thing. Nothing is learned at all from a run that failed or was
interrupted — a procedure learned from a broken run teaches the break.

Retrieval is budgeted rather than dumped. A handful of pinned records are always
present; the rest is searched per prompt (SQLite FTS5, BM25-ranked) and capped
hard. Everything else stays one `memory(action="search")` away. In practice a
store of 42 records puts about 130 tokens in front of the model. The block is
emitted as an event, so it is in the thread and in the recording: you can see
exactly what the agent was primed with before it answered.

Lexical search rather than embeddings is a deliberate choice, not a shortcut —
for one person's memory the recall problem is small, and a BM25 hit you can
explain beats a cosine distance you cannot. Embeddings are a later optimisation
if recall proves insufficient.

### The knowledge web

Press `k`. Everything the agent knows, as a graph: colour by kind, size by how
often it has been recalled, a ring for pinned, faded for provisional. Click a
node for its content, its tags, and the session it came from. Pin it to load it
every time, retire it, or delete it for good.

The point is not the picture. Memory you cannot see is memory you cannot
correct — an agent that has quietly decided something wrong about you will keep
acting on it forever unless there is somewhere to go and say no.

## Work that starts by itself

Three things in Autora run without you asking, and they are deliberately
different shapes:

| Starts because | Where | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A time came | Settings → **Scheduled tasks** | A cron expression and a prompt. With a **watch** attached, the cron is how often to look at a page, a file or a command's output, and the prompt runs only when what it saw changed. |
| Something outside said so | Settings → **Scheduled tasks** → **Triggers** | A URL, a secret and a prompt. Anything that can make an HTTP request starts it. |
| The console finished something | Settings → Configuration → **Proactivity** | A background job that outlives its turn is read and reported by a turn the console starts itself. |

A **trigger** exists because not everything that matters is on a clock or a
page. A CI run knows when it has finished; a script on another box knows when
its data landed. Give it somewhere to shout and it becomes a turn here, in a
session of its own, exactly like a scheduled run — same notifications, same
session list, same budget:

```bash
# shown once when the trigger is made, then never again
curl -s -X POST https://box.example.ts.net:8443/api/triggers/trig-abc123/fire \
  -H "x-autora-token: <the secret>"
```

The token can go in `x-autora-token`, in `Authorization: Bearer`, or as
`?token=`, and the body is passed to the turn as *data* — it came from the
network, so it is somebody else's words, and the turn is told so. A trigger
with no secret cannot be armed, the secret is compared in constant time and
can be rotated without losing the trigger's history, and a trigger is only
ever listed with its fingerprint, never its secret.

**Proactivity** is the one thing here that speaks without being spoken to. Off
by default: with the wake switch on, a background job that finishes is read by
a turn the console starts in the chat that began it — at most three times an
hour, never inside your quiet hours, and only while the day's automation
budget lasts. It is a turn, so it costs what a turn costs. With it off,
nothing is lost: the job's result still arrives with the next thing you say.

A chat's **permissions** (Yolo or Ask) decide what waits for you, and its
**mode** (Build, Plan or Agent) decides how the agent goes about the work; both
are per conversation and saved with it. Neither weakens anything below: the
guard's standing agreements and the irrecoverable tier ask whatever they say.

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini key — or add one in Settings instead |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI key |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic Claude key |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | DeepSeek key |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter key |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | Starting model for Gemini (default `gemini-flash-latest`, the rolling free-Flash alias); a model chosen in Settings wins |
| `GEMINI_THINKING_BUDGET` | Thinking tokens (default `0` for a responsive console; `-1` lets the model decide) |
| `AUTORA_STATE_DIR` | Where settings, keys and the spend ledger are written (default: `$AUTORA_HOME/settings`, else `.autora/` beside the app) |
| `AUTORA_PORT` / `AUTORA_HOST` | Where to listen (default `3000` on `127.0.0.1`, this machine only; set `AUTORA_HOST=0.0.0.0` to reach it from other devices. The container uses `8817` on `0.0.0.0`) |
| `AUTORA_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Names Autora may be addressed by beyond addresses, `localhost`, single-label names, `.local`/`.lan`/`.internal`/`.home.arpa` and Tailscale's `.ts.net`, comma separated (`.example.com` allows a domain and everything under it; `*` turns the check off). A request under any other name is refused, which stops a DNS-rebinding page from talking to Autora. Set it when Autora is behind your own domain |
| `AUTORA_TRUSTED_PEERS` | Hostnames or addresses, comma separated, that alone may connect to the plain port (loopback always may). The Umbrel app sets its own proxy, so another app on Docker's shared network cannot reach Autora past the login. A name that never resolves leaves the port open and says so in the log |
| `AUTORA_WORKDIR` | Where the agent's commands run when Settings names no directory (the Umbrel app sets `/host`, the host's filesystem) |
| `AUTORA_TLS` | `1` also serves https on the next port up, with a certificate Autora issues from its own authority (download it at `/autora-ca.crt`) |
| `AUTORA_TLS_PORT` | Where the https listener goes (default: `AUTORA_PORT` + 1) |
| `AUTORA_TLS_CERT` / `AUTORA_TLS_KEY` | A real certificate and key (PEM files) to use instead of Autora's own |
| `AUTORA_TLS_NAMES` | Extra names or addresses, comma separated, for the certificate shown to a browser that connects by bare IP |
| `AUTORA_LLM_BASE_URL` | Local OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `AUTORA_BROWSER_PATH` | The Chromium to drive (default: the usual system paths; `/usr/bin/chromium-browser` in the container) |
| `AUTORA_CONTEXT_TOKENS` | The context window the prompt is kept inside (default `100000`; set it to your model's window for small local models) |
| `AUTORA_COMPACT_AT` | Fraction of that window at which older turns are folded into working memory in the background (default `0.75`) |
| `AUTORA_PROTECTED_TURNS` | Most recent messages that are never summarised (default `6`) |
| `AUTORA_MAX_TOOL_TOKENS` | Tool output longer than this is kept in the session vault, with its start and end left in the prompt (default `3000`) |
| `AUTORA_COMPACTION_MODEL` | A cheaper model of the same provider to write the working memory with (default: Settings' Background model, then the talk-mode model, then the chat model) |
| `AUTORA_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | Output tokens the model may write per step of a task (default: 8192) |
| `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` | Speak through Deepgram's hosted Aura voices; a key saved in Settings -> Secrets wins |
| `AUTORA_DEEPGRAM_VOICE` | The Deepgram voice to start with (default `aura-2-thalia-en`); a voice picked in Settings wins |
| `AUTORA_BROWSER_HEADED` | `1` shows a real browser window instead of running headless |
| `AUTORA_BROWSER_FPS` / `AUTORA_BROWSER_QUALITY` / `AUTORA_BROWSER_STREAM_WIDTH` | How much live video to send (default `10` fps, at most `30`; quality `50`; scaled to `960` wide) |
| `AUTORA_BROWSER_TZ` / `AUTORA_BROWSER_LOCALE` | The time zone and language the browser reports to sites (default: looked up from this machine's public address, kept a week) |
| `AUTORA_SHELL` | The shell commands run in when Settings names none (then `$SHELL`, then bash, ash, sh) |
| `AUTORA_DEEPGRAM_STT_MODEL` / `AUTORA_DEEPGRAM_STT_LANG` | What talk mode listens with through Deepgram (default `nova-2`, `en-US`) |
| `AUTORA_DEEPGRAM_STT_URL` | A Deepgram-compatible listening server to use instead of Deepgram's (the key is sent there) |
| `AUTORA_MCP_BIN_DIR` | Where downloaded MCP server binaries go (default `$AUTORA_HOME/bin`) |
| `AUTORA_PUSH_SUBJECT` | The contact sent to push services with phone notifications (default `mailto:autora@localhost.invalid`) |
| `AUTORA_HOME` | State directory (default `~/.autora`; `/data` in the container) — the one place that survives an update |

## Where sessions live

```
~/.autora/sessions/<id>/
  events.jsonl     # the whole session, greppable, tailable
  blobs/           # content-addressed frames (deduped)
  meta.json
```

`tail -f ~/.autora/sessions/<id>/events.jsonl` is a supported debugging path, not
an accident.

## Releasing to the Umbrel store

Umbrel decides whether an update exists by comparing one string: `version` in
`blofstedt-autora/umbrel-app.yml`. Not the image digest, not the commit. A
change can be merged, built and pushed to the registry, and every installed
copy will still report itself up to date — removing and re-adding the community
store re-fetches the same manifest and reaches the same conclusion.

So a change that reaches the container raises `version` in `package.json`
(and `package-lock.json`) and rewrites `releaseNotes`, which Umbrel shows on
the update. It leaves the manifest's `version` and the image tag in
`docker-compose.yml` alone: once main's image for the new version is in the
registry, the image workflow commits both to main itself
(`.github/scripts/offer_release.py`). Umbrel therefore never offers a version
whose image is still building. When pull requests raised the manifest
version themselves, an update taken in the minutes before the image finished
failed with "manifest unknown"; with `:latest`, it installed the previous
build under the new version number. CI enforces this on every pull request;
a change with no user-facing effect opts out with `[no release]` in the pull
request title or body.

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/check_release.py --base origin/main   # the same check, locally
```

## How this was built

Every line of this repository was written by an agent. The direction, the
decisions and the rejections were the author's; the typing was Claude Code's,
session after session. The history says so rather than hiding it -- commits
carry a `Claude-Session:` trailer pointing at the session they came from, and
`CLAUDE.md` is in the tree. The harness itself does the committing, so the
author line is the agent that made the change -- `Claude` for the sessions that
typed it, `Autora` for the ones the console ran itself -- and the release bot
commits the version offers it makes.

That is not a disclaimer. A harness for watching agents work is best evidenced by
having been built with one: the recordings of the sessions behind this code are
the same recordings the app makes for anybody else, which is why fixing a bug here
often means reading back the session that introduced it.

## Status

Working and tested: the event store and its backpressure, the agent loop and
its tools (terminal, browser, desktop relay, memory, schedules, MCP servers),
the web UI, replay, spoken replies and dictation through Deepgram, context
composition and compaction, accessibility-tree page reading, element picking,
the app window and its review, memory with provenance, the knowledge web.

Since those were written down, the set has grown into the app this README
describes: the windows beside the chat (PDF, Video, Music, 3D, Photo, Games,
Pages, Sheets, Slides) on one shared tool rail, the Organization and its
agents with their own minds, Threads, the to-do list with its steps, the
memory card on the rail, and the phone layout every window was rebuilt for.

```bash
npm test       # every tests/*.test.ts; the ones that need Chromium skip without it
npm run lint   # typecheck (client, server, tests), then ESLint
```

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for why it is built this way.
