# Architecture, and why it differs from the Gemini blueprint

## The premise

The complaint that started this was: *"Hermes is cool, but technical, and I hate
how you can't SEE what it's doing in real time."*

That sentence is a transparency requirement, not a latency requirement. The
Gemini blueprint spends nearly all of its complexity budget on shaving
milliseconds off voice round-trips, and gives the seeing part one line:

> Send the terminal output (via WebSockets) back to your Tauri overlay.

So the priorities here are inverted. The observability layer is the product; the
agent loop is a consumer of it; voice is a client of it. Everything below follows
from that.

---

## The central decision: one event log

Every observable act funnels through `Session.emit`. No `print`, no direct
socket write, no side channel. The event is persisted **before** it is published.

That ordering is load-bearing. Because nothing is broadcast that isn't already
on disk, a client can always reconnect with "I last saw seq N" and be brought
back to exactness. Which in turn means:

- **Live and replay are one code path.** The UI's `derive(events, cursor)` is a
  pure fold over an event prefix. Scrubbing to step 12 reproduces step 12
  exactly, because there is no second renderer to drift.
- **Recording is free.** It is not a feature; it is what already happened.
- **Backpressure becomes safe.** The bus is allowed to be lossy under load
  precisely because the log is not (see below).
- **Debugging is `tail -f`.** JSONL, not SQLite, because the log is the primary
  artifact and should be readable by a human at 3am with `grep`.

Frames are the exception to "everything in the log": a 10-minute browser session
is thousands of JPEGs. Those go to a content-addressed blob store and the event
carries a 64-char hash. Content addressing dedupes identical frames for free,
which matters more than it sounds — an agent waiting on a page emits dozens of
byte-identical frames. In the end-to-end test, 30 captured frames deduped to 5
stored blobs.

## Backpressure, which the blueprint has none of

`self.audio_buffer.extend(...)` with no bound, and a websocket send per frame, is
fine on localhost and falls over the moment anything is slow. The naive fixes
are both wrong: unbounded queues grow until the process dies, and drop-oldest
silently loses tool results, which makes the record a lie.

Autora's policy is per-kind, because the kinds differ semantically:

- **Frames are coalesced** — one slot per stream, newest wins. A slow viewer
  sees a lower frame rate, which is the correct degradation for video, and never
  falls behind.
- **Everything else is lossless.** If a subscriber can't keep up, it is
  disconnected with a resumable seq rather than fed a corrupted stream. It
  reconnects and replays from the log.

## One agent loop, not two

The blueprint runs Open Interpreter for shell and Browser Use for the web. That
is two agent loops, two conversation histories, two tool vocabularies, no shared
timeline. The first task that spans both — *"find why the deploy broke, then
check the staging site"* — has no coherent transcript and nothing to replay.

Here, every capability is a tool in one registry driven by one loop emitting to
one log. The composition problem disappears, and a new tool is narrated, logged,
gated and replayed without touching any of those systems.

## The permission gate exists before the fun part

A voice agent with shell access and production credentials needs a gate on day
one. Speech recognition misfires; "push to staging" and "push to stage" differ
by a phoneme. The blueprint pipes model output straight into
`{"tool":"bash","command":"supabase db push"}` and executes it.

Three decisions — ALLOW (record it), ASK (suspend, show the exact command, wait
for a human), DENY (refuse and explain, so the model routes around instead of
retrying). Ordering matters: DENY rules are evaluated first so a later ALLOW
can't shadow a hard stop, and `--yes` bypasses ASK but never DENY.

Two things this shook out that are worth knowing:

- **Prefix-anchored allowlists leak.** `cat README.md` is read-only;
  `cat README.md && ./malware` matches the same prefix. The allow rule requires
  the command to contain no `; & | > \` $()` — a chained command is not a
  read-only command.
- **Redaction belongs at the boundary.** Tool args are scrubbed before they
  reach the log, not after. The log is the thing you share when showing off a
  recording; it must not carry the token that was on the command line. The
  browser tool detects password fields from the DOM rather than trusting the
  model to flag them — a leaked password in a shareable recording is not
  recoverable.

## Barge-in is a cancellation problem, not an audio problem

The first implementation polled a cancel flag between tool yields. A tool
blocked in `process.wait()` yields nothing to poll between, so interrupting
`sleep 30` took 30 seconds. Polling cannot preempt a blocking await.

The fix races the work against the cancel event and actively cancels the task,
which propagates `CancelledError` into the tool and lets it kill its child
process group on the way out. Measured: **1ms** from `interrupt()` to turn end,
with no orphaned processes.

(A related bug worth recording: the TTS worker caught `CancelledError` to handle
barge-in and never re-raised, making the worker itself impossible to shut down.
Catching cancellation requires deciding whose cancellation it was.)

## Why voice quality is not a TTS problem

A small local model at 82M is perfectly pleasant, and so are Deepgram's hosted
Aura voices. Agent voice is unbearable for other reasons, roughly in this
order:

1. **It reads code, paths, JSON and hashes aloud.** Nothing breaks the spell
   faster than "slash home slash user slash dot config slash app dot t s x".
2. **It can't be interrupted**, so correcting it means waiting it out.
3. **It goes silent for the 90 seconds a tool runs**, and thinking is
   indistinguishable from crashed.
4. **It waits for the full response before speaking**, adding latency no vocoder
   wins back.

`speakable()` and `splitSpeakable()` in `src/lib/voice.ts` fix 1, 3 and 4; the
loop's cancellation fixes 2. Swapping the TTS model is the *last* thing to try.

One concrete detail: the blueprint flushes TTS on any `.` or `,`, which splits
`3.5` and `e.g.` mid-token and produces stuttering. The chunker emits at genuine
sentence boundaries, with an abbreviation and decimal guard, falling back to soft
boundaries only once a split would be less noticeable than the wait.

Voice approvals fail safe: anything ambiguous is a no, and negatives are checked
before affirmatives, so "yes — no, wait" denies.

### The phone is a second voice client, not the same one

The first voice client opened the *host* machine's microphone. That is right at
a desk and useless from a phone, which is where watching an agent work actually
happens -- so the web UI has its own voice path, in the browser
(`src/lib/voice.ts`), with nothing crossing the wire but the text and, for
Deepgram's hosted voices, the audio the server fetches for it.

Two things carry across rather than being re-invented: the scrubber that keeps
paths, code, hashes and JSON out of the audio, and the clause chunker's
boundary rules, decimal and abbreviation guards included. The same reply read
by the CLI and by a phone should sound the same, and both failure modes above
are easy to walk straight back into.

What differs is the failure surface. Recognition is the browser's, so it can be
missing entirely (Firefox today), and the controls that depend on it do not
render rather than appearing and not working. Safari ends recognition after
every phrase, so continuous listening is a restart loop with a cap on it. iOS
will not speak unless the first utterance descends from a user gesture, so live
chat primes the synthesiser inside the tap that starts it. And the microphone
closes while the agent talks: a phone speaker two inches from a phone
microphone will otherwise transcribe the agent back to itself.

## On "iterative buffer prefilling"

The blueprint's centerpiece: re-transcribe a growing audio buffer while the user
speaks, and fire throwaway 1-token requests to warm the model's KV cache. It's a
clever idea that doesn't survive the details.

- SenseVoice is **non-autoregressive** — it transcribes the whole clip at once
  and *revises earlier words* as it gets more context. Prefix caching needs a
  byte-identical prefix. Revise token three and the GPU pass you just spent is
  discarded.
- The cacheable prefix is the **system prompt and tool schemas**, which sit
  *before* the user text. With a screenshot attached, image tokens sit in front
  too. The user's half-sentence is the least cacheable part of the prompt.
- Every speculative prefill **occupies the GPU the real request needs** and
  evicts blocks from the cache it's trying to warm.

The version that pays off is caching the static prefix — identical on every turn,
never invalidated by a re-transcribe, one flag on the request. That is what the
Anthropic adapter does with `cache_control`. Measure time-to-first-token before
building anything more elaborate; on a warm local model the bottleneck is
usually TTS, not the LLM.

## On the model choice

`Qwen 3.8 27B (Q4_K_M)` served by vLLM, in the blueprint, is not a thing that
exists. Qwen3 ships 30B-A3B / 32B / 235B-A22B; `Q4_K_M` is a llama.cpp GGUF
quantization that vLLM does not load (it wants AWQ/GPTQ/FP8). You'd be blocked
before the first token.

More usefully: model choice is the thing you'll change most often, and it's
entangled with tool-call dialects, streaming shapes and vision payloads. So it's
an interface, and the harness holds no vendor types. Two adapters ship —
Anthropic, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (vLLM, Ollama, llama.cpp, LM
Studio), so a local Qwen is a config change.

The honest caveat: local 27–32B models are markedly worse at *multi-step* tool
calling than frontier hosted ones — not at producing one well-formed call, but at
**recovering** when a selector misses or a build fails, which is most of what an
agent session actually is. Consider routing by task: local for transcription and
classification, hosted for the planning loop.

## Web UI, not a Tauri overlay

For v1: zero install, reachable from a phone, and the same surface as replay.
Tauri makes sense later for an always-on desktop overlay, but it's a distribution
choice, not an architecture one — it would consume the same websocket.

## The interface

The first version was a functional developer tool: 11px monospace everywhere,
three fixed columns, no motion. It worked and it was ugly, which for a product
whose entire pitch is *watching* is a real failure rather than a cosmetic one.

The visual model is a broadcast console: quiet chrome, and motion spent only on
things that are genuinely happening. Surfaces are layered
rather than flat — elevation instead of boxes drawn around everything — and
color is used semantically (amber means a decision is waiting on you, red means
something failed) rather than decoratively.

Three things the redesign shook out that were more than styling:

- **The approval prompt was unreadable.** It rendered the same flattened string
  the policy patterns match against, so authorizing a command meant reading
  `bash command=printf '\033[1;36m...'`. Matching wants over-matching; a human
  wants the command. They are now separate functions, and the one thing you must
  actually read before clicking is legible.
- **Hovering the primary button made it look disabled.** `.btn:hover:not(:disabled)`
  outranks `.btn.primary`, so hover stripped the gradient. Variants now drive a
  custom property, which takes specificity out of the question entirely.
- **ANSI escapes were reaching the model.** The terminal needs them; the model
  does not. Stripping them for the model-facing string collapsed a 200-frame
  progress bar from 9,890 characters to 45. (The first attempt at this blanked
  every line of output, because a PTY ends lines with CRLF and the
  carriage-return rule took the empty segment after it. The agent-loop test
  caught it.)

Fonts are vendored rather than loaded from a CDN. This tool runs on localhost
and should work on a plane; a webfont host also learns every time you open a
session. Variable weights keep it to two files and 77KB.

## Choices I'd revisit

- **Parallel tool execution, only where it cannot collide.** Calls made together
  in one response, and agents started together, first go through an overlap
  analysis (`server/overlap.ts`): each gets a footprint of what it reads and
  changes, and only calls that touch nothing in common share a moment. A shell,
  the browser page, an edit, or any tool not understood runs alone, in the order
  it was asked for. Answers come back in call order. Not with Ask on.
- **Fold-from-zero in the UI.** O(n) per render keeps it honest with no
  incremental cache to get subtly wrong. Fine to tens of thousands of events;
  past that, memoize on checkpoints.
- **Desktop control is a relay, not a container.** A single file on the machine
  with the screen, connecting out, is what makes "control my actual PC" a
  download rather than an install. The richer shape is still a containerized
  desktop (Xvfb + WebRTC, neko-style) that the UI can embed and a human can
  *take over* — human takeover being the thing Hermes most conspicuously lacks.
- **The work lives in the transcript, not in a stage.** A docked stage showed
  only the newest state of each kind, so the command you wanted to re-read had
  scrolled away and the page the agent looked at had been replaced. Each call
  now keeps its own output, its own frames and its own diff where it happened,
  and reviewing is scrolling. The cost is that two things happening at once are
  read one after the other rather than side by side, and that a session of
  thousands of frames is a long page; the frames are content-addressed and the
  cards fold, which has been enough so far.
- **A PDF is worked on together, in an editor, not handed back as a file.**
  The PDF tools used to flatten what the agent drew into each result, so a
  signature in the wrong place meant asking for another version. Now the file
  opens in Spectra-PDF's editor beside the chat (`server/spectra.ts`,
  `spectra-editor/`, the engine from `spectra/PIN.json`), and the person can
  work on it with everything that editor has -- pages, comments, forms,
  redaction, OCR, signatures. The window is Autora's: the file it opens is the
  desk's copy (`server/pdfdesk.ts`), so what the agent does with `pdf_edit`
  still lands in the same document, and a change the agent makes while the
  window is open writes the file out again and reloads the editor onto it. The
  editor is its own build in an origin-less sandboxed frame because it renders
  files from anywhere; every command it makes is relayed through the window that
  holds it (`src/components/SpectraWindow.tsx`), and the engine is a Python
  child process the server starts per session (`server/spectra/engine.ts`). The
  cost is a second React in the image, a bridge of messages instead of shared
  state, and a Python runtime and its packages in the image.
- **What the port cost, in the editor itself.** Spectra's renderer expects a
  desktop: a frame without an origin has no `localStorage` and no
  `navigator.locks`, both of which it uses on the way up, so they are replaced
  in memory (`spectra-editor/src/autora/sandbox.ts`); the commands it used to
  send to Rust go to Autora instead (`spectra-editor/src/autora/`), and the
  ones Autora has no answer for are refused by name rather than faked. The
  window brings the opened document to the front itself: a hand-over can be
  focused before the store has taken the file, which leaves the editor on Home
  with the document behind it.
- **A document is written as a description, not drawn at coordinates.**
  Researching and writing a PDF in one turn went badly when the only way to put
  words on a page was `pdf_edit`'s positioned items: every new finding meant
  working out where each line now sat. `pdf_compose` (`server/compose.ts`) takes
  blocks (headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, pictures, each with an id and an
  optional source), lays them out with pdf-lib's built-in fonts, and the window
  keeps the description beside the pages. A change is `update` / `insert` /
  `remove` by id and the whole file is laid out again; objects placed on top stay
  where they were. The description is dropped the moment the pages change any
  other way (the person reorders them, a page-level `pdf_edit`, declining the
  update), since it would no longer be what the file is. The start-of-turn
  briefing carries its outline (page, heading, block id, how it starts), which
  rides in the anchored note and so survives compaction. The cost is the
  built-in fonts: Western European text only, other characters replaced by "?"
  and said.
- **The policy default was ASK**, and it annoyed people into not using it. The
  default is now Yolo: every call runs and is shown as it happens, Stop reaches
  the running process, and a chat can be switched to Ask -- all changes, or
  only the ones the person describes -- when it is worth the interruptions.
