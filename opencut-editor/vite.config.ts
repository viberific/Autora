 * Next in a handful of places (links, images, the router). Rather than edit
 * those files, the `next/*` names are aliased to Autora's own stand-ins
 * (src/autora/shims/), the same way spectra-editor/ answers Spectra's Tauri
 * calls. Where the editor keeps its projects (IndexedDB, OPFS) is replaced by
 * files under overlay/web/, which keep them on Autora's server instead.
