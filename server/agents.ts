/**
 * The organization: the agents there are, what each is for and who it reports to.
 *
 * Autora starts with one agent, the lead, which is whatever answers in the
 * chat. The person adds others on the Organization page (a researcher, an
 * editor, a bookkeeper), each with its own task and a line on when it should be
 * called. The lead is told this map every turn and starts one with the agents
 * tool when a job calls for it. There is no pathway between agents: the agent
 * does its own task and its report comes back, so a chain nobody asked for
 * cannot run up a bill on a simple errand.
 *
 * Stored as `agents.json`. Pure apart from that: the tool that runs an agent
 * lives with the turn loop in server.ts.
