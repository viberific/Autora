/**
 * What automated runs are allowed to cost.
 *
 * A scheduled job or watcher runs in a session of its own, and a session of
 * its own loads the whole prompt, the tool list and the memory that goes with
 * it before the job has done anything at all. That is a fixed cost per
 * firing, and a watcher pointed at something that changes often -- a release,
 * a build, a feed -- pays it again every single time. Left unmeasured that is
 * how a quiet background job becomes the largest line on the bill: nothing
 * was watching the watchers.
 *
 * So automation has a budget apart from what the person spends talking to the
 * agent, checked twice:
 *
 *  - before a job is allowed to start: what all automated runs have cost
 *    today, against the day's budget;
 *  - every round of a run that is already going: what this one run has cost,
 *    against the per-run budget, so a single job that has begun to chew
 *    through a session is stopped rather than left to finish.
 *
 * Neither check ever deletes or disables a job. A job that has run out of
 * budget keeps its cron, its next time and its place: it is the spending that
 * is stopped, not the schedule, and the person is told once when it happens.
