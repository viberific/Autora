/**
 * Standing agreements: things the person has already said yes to.
 *
 * The guard asks about a call when it thinks the call could destroy something
 * and the person did not ask for it -- and then asks again about the same
 * kind of thing the next time, and the time after that. That is the wrong
 * shape for work that is repeated: restarting the same container, re-running
 * the same deploy, clearing the same cache directory. Each of those is a
 * decision the person has already made.
 *
 * A rule here says: this tool, doing something whose words include this, is
 * agreed from now on. It is remembered, it is shown back to the person, and
 * it can be revoked -- a class of work, not a blank cheque.
 *
 * What a rule can never do: cover the irrecoverable tier. Formatting a disk,
 * wiping a Docker volume, force-pushing over main and deleting the whole tree
 * are asked about every single time, however many rules there are. Those are
 * checked in server/guard.ts before the guard this one feeds, and this
 * file deliberately has no say in them.
