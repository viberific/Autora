/**
 * What you have spent, folded into the few shapes the billing page asks for.
 *
 * The ledger is one row per turn; nothing here writes to it. Everything below
 * is a read: totals for the headline, a breakdown by vendor and model for the
 * "where is it going" question, a day-by-day series for the chart, and the
 * last few turns so a surprising number can be traced to the turn that caused
 * it.
 *
 * One honesty rule runs through all of it. A turn whose model was not in the
 * price table contributes nothing to the money figures and is counted
 * separately as unpriced; a turn whose token counts we estimated is counted as
 * estimated. A single number that quietly blends measured, guessed, and
 * unknown is worse than no number, because it cannot be checked against the
 * vendor's own invoice -- which is the only thing that actually charges you.
