/**
 * Autora 3D: the 3D modelling window, and the agent's hands on the same model.
 *
 * Autora 3D (autora-3d/, a copy of the standalone 3D-Modeling app built by `npm run build`) is a sketch-and-extrude CAD
 * modeller. Here it is a window beside the conversation, and one model per chat that the agent and the person both work
 * on. The model lives on this server, in the same headless engine the app is built on (dist/autora-3d-engine/):
 *
 *   - the agent's `cad_*` tools run on it (`runCadTool`), and every change is pushed to the window, which shows it;
 *   - the person works in the window as in the app on its own, and what they change goes back here
 *     (`PUT /api/cad/:session/doc`), so the agent's next call sees it.
 *
 * Who made a change travels with it (`by`): the window reloads the model for the agent's changes and never for its
 * own person's, so a drag in progress is not interrupted by an echo of itself.
 *
 * The engine is loaded from its bundle at run time rather than imported: it is the app's own code (three.js, a WebAssembly
 * geometry kernel), built by the autora-3d sub-project, and the server is typechecked without it. Without the build the
 * tools are simply not offered (`cadAvailable`).
