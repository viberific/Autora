/**
 * Changing a file so that someone else's edits to it survive.
 *
 * The agent used to write files with shell redirects and `sed`, which replace
 * whatever is on disk with what the agent believes is there -- so a change the
 * person saved a moment earlier was silently lost. This is the careful way: the
 * agent says what to replace, and if the file is no longer as the agent last saw
 * it, the two sets of changes are merged (server/merge3.ts) and written only if
 * they do not clash. A clash writes nothing and tells the agent what the person
 * did, so it can decide.
