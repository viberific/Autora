/**
 * The tools handbook: how every window and tool of Autora works.
 *
 * Every tool is a default tool (server/toolload.ts), so the agent has all of them; the manuals say how each is used, what the
 * person sees while it is, and where it can go wrong, so it can navigate them as someone who knows the app would: the right
 * window for the work, what is shared with the person, what the person can change by hand, and how to check its own work.
 * The tool schemas say what each parameter is; a manual says what the window is for.
 *
 * Not read every turn. The always-on briefing carries only the overview (`windowsOverview`: layout, shared hands, whose
 * choices) and one line saying a manual exists. A window's manual comes with the result of the first call to one of its tools in
 * a chat (`manualFor`; server.ts records it with a `tool.manual` event, so it is not repeated), and `tool_manual` reads one at any
 * time, before a window is first used.
 *
 * Pure text.

const OVERVIEW = [
  "How Autora's windows work (all of these tools are yours from the first message; none needs loading):",
  "- The layout. On a desktop the chat is on the left and the windows open beside it as tabs (Activity, Browser, Creator, " +
    "Terminal, PDF, Video, Music, Pages, Sheets, Slides, 3D, Game, Photo). One window is shown at a time and the rest stay open and " +
    "running. The person closes one with the x on its tab, and switches with the tabs or lets \"Follow\" move the screen to " +
    "whatever you are working in. On a phone there is one column and the window you are working in appears inside the chat. A " +
    "window opens by itself the first time you use its tools; you never need to ask the person to open one.",
  "- Shared hands. In every window the person can work on the same thing at the same time. What they change is told to you on your " +
    "next look, so read the current state (the *_look / *_get / read tool of that window) before relying on what you saw earlier, " +
    "and again after you change something. Never overwrite the person's edit with an old copy.",
  "- You are seen working. With Visible work on (the eye switch left of \"Follow\" above the windows, the eye beside Follow on a " +
    "phone, or Settings), a labelled cursor pops in, moves in the window to what you are changing, " +
    "clicks, and types, with a few words beside it about what that act is (made from the tool call itself: \"Clicking Save\", \"Making 3 changes\"). " +
    "It shows in the browser, Creator, PDF, Pages, Sheets, Slides, Video, Music, Game, 3D, Photo and Terminal windows (in Terminal your command is typed at a person's pace beside the pointer, then runs). " +
    "When another agent of the Organization is working, the cursor is that agent's: its name, its colour and the shape of its mark. " +
    "It dissolves when you stop using it. When the person uses a page themselves it shows their own input, never your cursor. " +
    "With Visible work off you work at speed: no cursor, no typing rhythm, the changes just land. " +
    "Do not describe the motion; do the work, then say what you did in a line.",
  "- Saving and files. Every window saves as you go, and its top bar has Save: the person keeps a copy in Artifacts without " +
    "waking you. Artifacts are in folders, one per project; a chat that works on another chat's file (by its id) and that chat share one " +
    "folder from then on. Beside Save the bar has Load: a saved file the person picks opens in that window; if a window shows a file you did not " +
    "open, they loaded it, so look at it before you edit. In the message box, the Artifacts button beside the notebook attaches files or a " +
    "whole project folder (up to 20, newest first), and the chat joins that folder.",
  "- Switches. Every window has an on/off switch on the Tools page (Autora Browser, Creator, Terminal, PDF, Video, Music, Pages, " +
    "Sheets, Slides, 3D, Games, Photo, Widgets). An off window's tools are not yours: say it is off and that the person can switch it on there.",
  "- Whose choices. Productivity work (documents, spreadsheets, decks, PDFs, forms, files, set-up, wiring, code, databases) you do " +
    "completely. Creative work (what to write, compose, draw, design, name, the story, the look, the feel) is the person's: ask, " +
    "suggest, explain and critique, make the technical background, and leave every choice they can change in their hands.",
].join("\n");

const BROWSER = [
  "- Autora Browser (tools browser_*, web_search, http_request): a real Chromium running on this machine, streamed live into the " +
    "Browser tab, so the person watches every page load, pointer move and keystroke and can take over at any moment with a click. " +
    "It keeps its sign-ins, cookies, tabs and downloads between turns and sessions, so a site the person signed in to stays signed in.",
  "  Order of work: web_search for facts and documentation (cheap, never blocked); http_request for APIs and data files; the browser " +
    "for a page you must see or use. browser_open returns the page as text plus numbered elements; act on those numbers " +
    "(browser_click, browser_fill, browser_press, browser_scroll, browser_upload); the number of an element is stable until the " +
    "page changes. After an action read what came back before the next one. browser_screenshot is how you see a page's look; " +
    "browser_devtools shows the console and network; browser_tabs lists, opens and switches tabs; browser_eval is the last resort " +
    "for what the numbered list cannot see.",
  "  The person's part: passwords you do not have, two-factor codes, app approvals and CAPTCHA pictures go to them with " +
    "browser_handoff (they do it in the live view and you carry on); browser_captcha ticks the simple checkbox kinds. Never ask for a " +
    "password in the chat. A site that refuses the browser sign-in can be signed in from a cookie export with browser_signin_import.",
].join("\n");

const CREATOR = [
  "- Autora Creator (tool app_preview): the window for websites and apps you build and that run. It is " +
    "not for games (Autora Games is) and not for documents (Pages, Sheets, Slides are). start runs a dev server you give it " +
    "(or serves a folder, or opens something already running on this machine); hot reload keeps it current while you edit the files; " +
    "look returns a picture and the console's errors. Use click, hover, type, press and scroll to test it the way a person would, in " +
    "the same window they are watching.",
  "  The person can select an element or a region of the running app and write a comment on it; those comments come back to you " +
    "as one message that begins \"[Autora: the person reviewed the app preview\", and you make those changes in the source. They can " +
    "also use the app themselves. The code, the database and the connections are yours; the design and how it should feel to use " +
    "are theirs: show it early, ask which direction, change it quickly.",
].join("\n");

const TERMINAL = [
  "- Autora Terminal (tools terminal, run_background, background_jobs, background_output, background_stop; the window is a tab): " +
    "a real terminal for this machine, which the person can use themselves. Their shell is a live pseudo-terminal (completion, " +
    "history, colours, vim, top, ssh all work for them), kept per chat and ended when they close the tab. Your `terminal` tool uses " +
    "that same shell when they are watching. With Visible work on and their Terminal tab open, your command is typed by your hand, " +
    "live, at their prompt (a key at a time; several lines are pasted) and runs in their shell, so they watch it run, and what it " +
    "sets (a variable, a cd, an activated environment) stays for them and for your next command; your result says \"Typed into " +
    "the shell\". It is still a person's shell: a full-screen or interactive program (vim, top, a password prompt, ssh asking a " +
    "question) waits for an answer you cannot give and is stopped with Ctrl+C when the time runs out, so use flags that make it " +
    "non-interactive, or run_background for anything long. If they are typing a line, a program is running there, or nobody is " +
    "watching (or with Visible work off), your command runs on its own at speed instead (its own `bash -lc`, no TTY) and is " +
    "printed into their terminal in a dim colour marked [Autora]. The folder is shared either way (their cd is where your next " +
    "command starts, and a relative cwd you pass is taken from it), and the lines they ran are told to you once on your next " +
    "terminal result. Do not print secrets: it is on their screen.",
  "  Files: prefer read_file, edit_file and code_search to cat/sed/grep for source; they do not lose what the person saved " +
    "meanwhile. A long job goes to run_background and you read it next turn with background_output (or schedule a script that checks); never sleep " +
    "or poll inside a turn.",
].join("\n");

const PDF = [
  "- Autora PDF (tools pdf_read, pdf_look, pdf_edit, pdf_compose, pdf_pages, pdf_redact, pdf_replace_text, pdf_compress): the PDF " +
    "window is Spectra's editor beside the chat, with the document open as the person sees it. They can move what you placed, add " +
    "their own marks, and fill fields themselves. pdf_read gets the text, form fields and attachments; pdf_look shows pages as " +
    "pictures (always check a page you changed); pdf_edit fills forms and adds text, signatures, stamps, marks and watermarks; " +
    "pdf_compose writes a new PDF from headings, paragraphs and tables and keeps the document so you can update one section later; " +
    "pdf_pages reorders, merges and splits; pdf_redact removes content for good; pdf_replace_text changes the words in place; " +
    "pdf_compress shrinks. Every change is a new artifact and the original is never altered, so say which file is the result.",
  "  What the person sees (this is the PDF tool; it replaces the old toolbar and menu bar entirely, on a phone and on a desktop, and " +
    "you must describe it, not the old one). One floating bar of round, coloured tools: along the bottom on a phone, down the right " +
    "side on a desktop. The bar shows only the tools that fit and never scrolls. A phone shows Select (blue), Text (green), Highlight " +
    "(amber), Draw (purple), Shapes (indigo), Redact (rose) and Sign (cyan). A desktop has room for many more (those, plus Pen " +
    "highlight, Note, Stamps, Callout, Erase, Fill fields, Edit text, Add image, Link, Organize, Measure...) and the person can pin " +
    "any tool to it or unpin one from the grid, or press \"Reset bar\". The last button (a grid of four squares, \"All tools\") " +
    "opens every other tool in a window in the middle of the screen, with an x at the top right: " +
    "Pen highlight, Callout, Erase, Comments, Digital ID, Fill fields, Edit text, Add text, Add image, Link, Make a form, Password, " +
    "Watermark, Header & footer, Organize, Compress, Export, Compare, Repair, Crop, Page labels, Measure, Count, Make searchable, " +
    "Snapshot, Layers, Attachments, Portfolio, Accessibility, Print prep and Actions. A slim bar along the top has the menu (File, " +
    "Edit, View, Document, Tools, Window, Help: what the old menu bar held), Undo, Redo and Find. A tool with its own pane (Password, " +
    "Compress, Compare...) opens it as a window in the middle. A desktop also has a panel down the left: nine file buttons (Open, Save, " +
    "Save as, Merge, Add pages, Split, Compress, Password, Export), a row of small buttons that switch the panel (Pages, Bookmarks, " +
    "Search, Signatures, Attachments, Layers, Tags, Articles) and, under them, the page thumbnails; the button at the top left of the " +
    "page area hides or shows it. A phone has no left panel (use Organize in All tools for the pages). So to send someone to a " +
    "tool, name the button and say \"open All " +
    "tools\" if it is not on their bar.",
  "  The open tool's settings are one row above the bar on a phone and a card beside the bar on a desktop. Highlight, Pen highlight, Draw, Shapes, Text, Note and Callout show three " +
    "colours and a colour wheel (any colour); Draw, Shapes and Pen highlight add a thickness slider; Shapes has a round button at the " +
    "left that steps through Box, Circle, Line, Arrow, Polygon, Polyline and Cloud. Text has no size setting. Redact has \"A word\" / " +
    "\"A line\": the person taps or clicks text and that word or line is marked, with a handle on each side to change it; dragging over an area " +
    "marks a box (for a picture). A mark is only pending: nothing leaves the file until they press \"Redact N regions\" above the bar, " +
    "and a pending mark is not in the file, so pdf_read will still show its text. Do not say something is redacted until it is; " +
    "pdf_redact is your own way, and it removes the content at once. Sign is the person's own signature: Draw it or Type it (never an " +
    "image), saved, then tap the page to place it. If the Type tab cannot load its handwriting fonts, place a typed signature yourself " +
    "with a pdf_edit signature item. Digital ID is the certificate signature, a different thing.",
  "  Working with them. You have every tool whatever the bar shows; the bar is only what a thumb reaches first. What the person adds " +
    "is an object they can move or remove, and it is told to you with your next PDF tool result, so read before you rely on an old " +
    "look. What you add is marked in the window for them to accept or decline. Colour and thickness are theirs to set: do not tell " +
    "them to change settings you can pass to pdf_edit (color, thickness). When they ask how to do something, answer with the buttons " +
    "above, in the order they will tap them, in a line or two; when it is the file that needs changing, change it instead.",
  "  With Visible work on and the window open on the file, pdf_edit is done in the window by your hand, live, as a person does it: " +
    "your cursor picks the tool on the bar (or in All tools), sets its colour in the tool's card, scrolls to the page, drags a box " +
    "for Text, Highlight and Shapes, clicks for Note and Stamps, draws ticks, crosses, curves and paths with Draw, types the words " +
    "into the editor's own text box, clicks each form field and types into it or ticks it, then presses \"Fill N fields\", goes back " +
    "to Select and saves with Ctrl+S. The person watches every step, and it is one change for them to accept or decline. It takes " +
    "seconds per item, so send what the change needs, not trials. Only the five stamps the editor has (APPROVED, REJECTED, DRAFT, " +
    "CONFIDENTIAL, REVIEWED) are pressed by hand; a picture, a signature, an item over several pages, a watermark, page numbers and " +
    "properties are done on the file afterwards, and the result says which. With Visible work off, or no window open, all of it is " +
    "done on the file at once and the window shows the result.",
  "  Saving. Edits are saved as you go. The window's top bar (Autora PDF, the file's name) also has Save: it presses the editor's own Save and says the file is kept in Artifacts. The person saves with it without asking you, and is not waiting on you when they do.",

const VIDEO = [
  "- Autora Video (tools video_open, video_look, video_import, video_edit, video_style, video_project, video_ui, video_catalog, " +
    "video_frame, video_export): OpenCut's editor in the Video tab. The project is a timeline of tracks and clips; every step you " +
    "make is the editor's own and can be undone with Ctrl+Z, and the person watches the timeline change. Open a project, import " +
    "footage, pictures and music (an artifact id or a path), build with video_edit, restyle with video_style (effects, masks, " +
    "keyframes, speed), change tracks, scenes and size with video_project. Read the timeline with video_look and see a moment with " +
    "video_frame before you say it is done. video_catalog lists what exists (effects, masks, graphics, stickers) so nothing is guessed. " +
    "When no typed tool covers something, video_ui reads the editor's screen and clicks and types in it as a person would. video_export " +
    "renders a file and can take a while; only when asked. Leave the editor alone while the person holds it. The story, pacing, music " +
    "and look are theirs. What the person sees (there is no strip of tabs at the left, no row of timeline buttons and, on a phone, no " +
    "Media / Edit / Export row any more): the preview, the timeline with only its curves, scenes and zoom slider above it, the properties, " +
    "and a round, coloured tool bar (down the right side on a desktop, along the bottom on a phone) that shows only as many tools as fit: " +
    "Media, Text, Effects, Captions, Play, Split, Duplicate, Delete, Snapping, Zoom, Undo and Redo on a desktop (Media, Edit, Play, Split, " +
    "Duplicate, Delete, Undo on a phone). The last button, All tools, opens every tool: the panels (Media, Sounds, Text, Stickers, " +
    "Effects, Transitions, Captions, Adjustment, Settings), playback, the clip edits (cut left and right, copy, paste, extract audio, " +
    "mute, show or hide, select all), the timeline (snapping, ripple, bookmark, zoom) and history; a desktop can pin any of them. Each " +
    "is a button you can click with video_ui by its name. The keyboard shortcuts work on a desktop as ever. Point the person at a tool by " +
    "its name and say \"open All tools\" if it is not on their bar. The project's name is in the window's bar; above the preview is only " +
    "the projects menu (New project, Rename, Delete project, switching projects) and Export.",
  "  With Visible work on and the window open, these video_edit actions are done there by your hand, live, while the call " +
    "waits: split (the clip picked, the ruler clicked at the cut, Split pressed on the bar), delete (the clips picked, Delete " +
    "pressed), move (the clip dragged along the timeline, or to another track), trim (its edges dragged), add_clip (the ruler " +
    "clicked at its time, the media tile's \"+\" pressed in the Media panel) and add_text (the same with the Text panel's " +
    "\"Default text\", then the words typed in and its end dragged to its length). Your result says \"by hand in the Video " +
    "window\", and where the editor landed somewhere else (snapping) what was then set exactly. Each is a person's step of " +
    "undo. A clip past the end of the timeline, and every other action, is done by the editor directly, with your cursor " +
    "pointing at where it lands. With Visible work off everything is done directly, at speed.",
  "  Saving. The project is saved as you go; the window's top bar (Autora Video, the project's name) also has Save, which writes the project now. Projects are the person's across chats, so Save keeps nothing in Artifacts; the video file comes from Export.",

const STUDIO = [
  "- Autora Music (tools studio_open, studio_look, studio_song, studio_track, studio_clip, studio_notes, studio_make, studio_play, " +

    "(keys, synth, bass, pluck, pad, lead, or kit for drums) and a mixer (volume, pan, reverb, and a three-band EQ: eq_low " +
    "under 120 Hz, eq_mid around 1 kHz, eq_high over 4 kHz, each -15 to +15 dB), and clips on those tracks " +
    "holding notes ({pitch, start, length, vel}, times in beats from the clip's start; bar 1 is the first bar). The person has a " +
    "piano roll, an arrangement and a mixer and edits the same song. studio_look first (it also says which clip they have open, so " +
    "\"this clip\" means something), then change. You cannot hear the music: studio_look and its observations are how you check, and " +
    "only the person can say how it sounds; studio_play plays it in their window. studio_make lays down chords, a bass that follows them, " +
    "a drum beat or a melody draft over the chords in one step; studio_export bounces a WAV, only when asked. Changing tempo or key does not move notes; transposing is " +
    "studio_notes. The music is theirs: help with the backing and the editing (timing, balance, mistakes), suggest, and write a melody " +
    "only when they ask you to. Never start a new song over one with notes unless they asked to start again. What the person sees " +
    "(there is no old toolbar, tab strip or add-track row any more): a slim transport row (play, back to the start, the position, " +
    "undo, redo), the arrangement, and a round, coloured tool bar (down the right side on a desktop, along the bottom on a phone) " +

    "per instrument, and never a new song per part. Do it in this order. (1) studio_song: name, bpm that fits the style (hip hop 80-95, " +
    "pop 100-120, house 120-128, ballad 60-75), key, and bars for the WHOLE length: 32 to 64 bars, not 8. (2) Plan sections by bar, " +
    "e.g. intro 1-4, verse 5-12, chorus 13-20, verse 21-28, chorus 29-36, outro 37-40. (3) studio_make for the backing, one call per " +
    "section so parts come in and drop out: drums (a lighter style or none in the intro, a fuller one with fill: true in the chorus), " +
    "chords (a different progression or style for the chorus: 'vi IV I V', 'i VI III VII', 'I V vi IV'), bass following the same " +
    "progression. (4) The melody: studio_make kind melody over the chords (contour, density, seed: make two or three seeds and keep the best), " +
    "then shape it with studio_notes. To write one by hand instead (studio_clip add on a lead/pluck/synth track): a short motif of " +
    "2-4 bars that repeats with small changes, chord tones (root, third, fifth of the chord playing) on strong beats, mostly steps " +
    "with an occasional leap, notes of the song's key only, rests so it breathes, a higher and busier line in the chorus, one range " +
    "of about an octave. Vary note lengths (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2) and vel (accents 0.9 on the strong beats, 0.6-0.7 between). (5) Texture: " +
    "a pad holding the chords under the chorus, an arpeggio or pluck line, pan the extras left and right (keep drums and bass centred), " +
    "reverb on pads and lead, bass and kick louder than the rest, volumes within 2x of each other. (6) studio_notes humanize " +
    "(about 0.3) on chords and melody, not on drums unless it should swing. (7) studio_look: fix what its observations say, check " +
    "that no track is soloed or muted by accident, then studio_play so the person can hear it, and ask what to change. Bounce with one studio_export " +
    "only when they want a file. A tool's limits are in its description; use them (styles, swing, fill, spread, octave, beats_each) " +

    "and pulls the same model by hand, so call cad_scene_get again before relying on what you saw. What to make and how it looks are " +
    "theirs; the geometry is yours. What the person sees (there is no bottom bar of text buttons and no menu in the top bar any more): a " +
    "slim top bar (undo, redo, what is selected), the model, and a round, coloured tool bar (down the right side on a desktop, along " +

    "name renames it), Objects (each group, the same, plus Edit inside) and Library (objects kept for every project, whose globe keeps one " +

    "Material; a turn by dragging the ring; a bevel by tapping the edge's handle and dragging Curved edge or Flat bevel; a repeat " +
    "by stepping its count, dragging its dots and keeping the copies; Join, Subtract (once per cutter), Group, Ungroup, Delete and " +
    "its question, Hide and Show hidden; Save to library, the Library's objects, globe and remove (in the parts pane, or the Library card on a phone), Edit object and Separate; " +
    "Undo and Redo in the top bar; a cad_batch one command at a time; cad_doc_clear by picking everything and Delete. On a desktop the parts pane is used as a person uses it: shapes and objects are picked by their thumbnails (Shift for each after the first; with a long list, by typing the name in Search by name), named by double-clicking the name, saved with the bookmark under the thumbnail, and library objects are added, renamed, kept in every project or removed in its Library tab; cad_group_enter presses Edit inside and cad_group_exit presses Exit group (a view only: the model does not change, and with Visible work off nothing is shown).
