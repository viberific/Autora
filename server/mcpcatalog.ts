/**
 * MCP servers the agent knows how to set up, and when each one beats the
 * browser.
 *
 * The browser can reach anything a person can, which is exactly why it is
 * the slow way to reach a service that has an API: pages to load, sign-in
 * walls, markup to read, and an answer that breaks when the site is
 * redesigned. When a task lives on one of these services the agent offers
 * the server instead -- once, with the reason in one line -- and sets it up
 * if the person says yes (see `mcp_offer` in tools.ts).
 *
 * Entries use `npx` (Node is always there) or `uvx` (the app image includes
 * a pinned, Alpine-compatible `uv`); package dependencies are fetched on demand.
 * A key a server needs is named here, never stored
 * here: the offer card saves it to the secret store, and the config refers
 * to it as `${secret:NAME}`, resolved only at connect time (see mcp.ts).
