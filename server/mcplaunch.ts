/**
 * Getting an MCP server's launcher to run on this machine.
 *
 * Every catalog server is started with `npx`, which is why the catalog can
 * say that nothing needs installing first. A few of those launchers are not
 * Node programs, though: they download a compiled binary for the platform
 * and run that. @webclaw/mcp is one of them, and its platform map has no
 * musl entry -- linux/x64 always maps to the glibc build. Autora's own
 * container is Alpine (musl), so the launcher caches a binary that cannot
 * exec here, the server dies as it starts, and all the person sees is
 * "MCP error -32000: Connection closed".
 *
 * So before such a server is started we make sure the build for this machine
 * is on disk and put its path in the variable the launcher checks first
 * (WEBCLAW_MCP_BIN). One download, into the data directory rather than
 * /root/.cache -- which a container update wipes -- and the server works.
 *
 * None of it is fatal. A launcher that knows its own machine is left alone,
 * and if the build cannot be fetched the connection error says why.
