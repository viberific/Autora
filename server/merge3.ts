/**
 * Putting two people's edits to the same file together.
 *
 * The agent works from the file as it last saw it (`base`) and has made its
 * change (`ours`); meanwhile the person has saved theirs (`theirs`). If the two
 * touched different parts, both stay. If they touched the same lines
 * differently, nothing is written: the agent is told what they did and decides.
 * Edits that make the same change to the same lines agree, and are taken once.
 *
 * Lines, as in any three-way merge: each side is compared with the base, the
 * regions each changed are found, and regions that do not overlap are both
 * applied. Changes that merely touch (one ends where the next begins) are not
 * a conflict: neither overwrites the other.
