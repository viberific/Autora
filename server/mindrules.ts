/**
 * The rules the mind is kept by.
 *
 * A pile of notes written by whoever had a thought at the time is hard to
 * recall from: titles that say nothing about what they are about, a paragraph
 * holding five facts, a note about "right now" that was never true again, a
 * claim about how a website works with no word on where it came from. This is
 * what every write is held to, and what the tidy pass holds the old ones to,
 * so recall finds one thing per record under the name it is known by.
 *
 *  - One topic per record, short enough to read at a glance.
 *  - A title that starts with its subject: "GitHub: where repository settings are".
 *  - Durable: nothing about this conversation, nothing secret.
 *  - A `reference` is what the official source says -- how a product, API or
 *    interface works -- and carries where it was read and when. Interfaces
 *    change, so a reference is checked against its source again after a while.
 *
 * Pure: text in, a verdict or a normalised entry out.
