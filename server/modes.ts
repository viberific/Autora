/**
 * How a chat works, and what it may do without asking. Two separate choices,
 * both made by the person, both per conversation.
 *
 * The WORK MODE is how the agent goes about a task (the selector in the
 * message box):
 *
 *  - build  do the work straight away, as Autora always has.
 *  - plan   read-only. Look, search, browse, and write the plan on the to-do
 *           list; nothing is written, run or sent. The person moves the chat
 *           to Build (or Agent) when the plan is right.
 *  - agent  the default. The agent chooses. Every turn starts in Plan; unless the task is
 *           very simple it investigates and writes the to-do list, then
 *           switches itself to Build and works through it, and back to Plan
 *           if the ground moves under it. The selector stays on Agent: the
 *           switches show in the chat.
 *
 * The PERMISSIONS are what may run without the person's yes (the selector in
 * the header):
 *
 *  - yolo   calls run as they come and are shown as they happen. The guard's
 *           standing agreements and the irrecoverable tier still stop and ask.
 *  - ask    calls that change something wait for a yes on a card, either all
 *           of them or -- when the person wrote down when to ask -- the ones
 *           that fall under what they wrote.
 *
 * Nothing here is a permission the agent can grant itself: both are written by
 * the person and read by the server, and the agent is told what they are.
