/**
 * A blank file, opened in its window -- the person's own way in.
 *
 * The agent starts a document by asking for one; this is how the person starts
 * one themselves, from the toolbox beside the message box. Tapping a tool there
 * makes a real, empty file and puts it in the window beside the conversation:
 * no message, no turn, and nothing asked of the model. The file is saved as an
 * artifact the moment it opens, so what they type has somewhere to go, it is
 * theirs to keep, and the agent finds it in the chat when they next say
 * something.
 *
 * The files come from the same engines the tools use -- GenOffice's command
 * line for a document, a workbook or a deck (./office.ts), and the PDF library
 * for a blank page -- so a file opened here is the same kind of file the agent
 * would have made, and one blank of each kind is kept once made.
