/**
 * The Office window: the document the agent is working on (Word, PowerPoint or
 * Excel), open beside the conversation in GenOffice's own editor for it, for
 * the person to watch and to work on too.
 *
 * One per session, the sibling of the PDF window (./pdfdesk.ts). It holds the
 * document as bytes. The editor (built into dist/office/web/<docs|slides|sheets>,
 * shown in a sandboxed frame by src/components/OfficeWindow.tsx) saves, and each
 * save lands here: the file everyone else sees -- the Office tools, the
 * thread's file card, a download -- is an artifact kept current from it, so
 * there is no save button to forget. When the agent changes the document, the
 * new bytes replace these and the window loads them.
 *
 * Word keeps its document in the page: the page sends the bytes. PowerPoint and
 * Excel keep it in an engine (GenOffice's main-process code, run by
 * ./officehost.ts as a child process, one per window): the page reaches it
 * through /ipc, the engine saves to a file of its own, and that file is watched.
 *
 * What the person did is told to the agent once, in a sentence made by
 * comparing the text before and after (paragraphs, slide text, cells): with
 * the next Office tool result, or at the start of its next turn.
 *
 * The editor runs in a frame with no origin of its own and talks to the page by
 * messages only; it never calls this server (see office/shim/common.js).
