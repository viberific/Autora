/**
 * The agent's hand in the PDF window (Visible work: docs/VISIBLE-WORK.md).
 *
 * With Visible work on and the PDF window open, what `pdf_edit` can do with the editor's own tools (text, notes,
 * highlights, shapes, lines, stamps, drawn marks, form fields) is not drawn onto the file here: it is handed to the
 * window, the first window of the chat to claim it does it there, live, by hand (spectra-editor/src/autora/hand.ts),
 * and presses Save; that save comes back to the desk as the agent's change (`expectHandSave` in pdfdesk.ts). The tool
 * call waits for all of it, so what the agent is told it did is what the person watched happen.
 *
 * No window claims it within a few seconds (none open, or nobody has the page) -> nobody is watching, and the edit is
 * done here at speed as with Visible work off.
