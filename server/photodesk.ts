/**
 * Autora Photo: the photo editing window, and the agent's hands on the same picture.
 *
 * Autora Photo is PhotoCraft (github.com/storytold/photocraft, MIT or Apache-2.0), an image editor written in Rust, built by
 * scripts/build-photo.mjs from the commit in photo/PIN.json into dist/photo/. It is two programs:
 *
 *   - its editor, WebAssembly in a frame beside the conversation (components/PhotoWindow.tsx), which the person works in:
 *     layers, masks, adjustment layers, type, brushes, filters, real PSD files;
 *   - its headless command line (`photocraft-cli serve`), which the agent's `photo_*` tools run: the same command
 *     registry the editor's menus call, so anything a person can click the agent can do.
 *
 * They share one file per chat, `work.pcraft` (PhotoCraft's own layered format), kept on this server:
 *
 *   - the agent's tools open it, change it and save it (`runPhotoTool`), and the window is told, and reloads it;
 *   - except with Visible work on and the window open: then the agent's edit is done in the window, by hand, as a person
 *     does it (`byHand`: its cursor goes through All tools and the command's dialog, see photo/overlay/autora.rs), and
 *     the window sends the picture back when it is done;
 *   - the person works in the window as in the app on its own, and a moment after they stop the editor sends the file
 *     back (`PUT /api/photo/:session/doc`), so the agent's next call sees what they did.
 *
 * Who made a change travels with it (`by`): the window reloads the picture for the agent's changes and never for its own
 * person's, so a brush stroke in progress is not interrupted by an echo of itself.
 *
 * The editor is a page of this origin in a frame (served below with a CSP); the window talks to it by postMessage only.
 * The command line gets a folder of its own per chat as its only file access.
