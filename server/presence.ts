/**
 * Working side by side: what the person is doing right now, and who has hold
 * of what.
 *
 * The agent and the person share a PDF, an app window, a browser and a folder
 * of code. Without a shared record the agent clicked on a page the person was
 * typing into, or rewrote a file they had just saved. This is that record, one
 * per chat, and three things come out of it:
 *
 *  - Leases. Whatever the person touches is theirs for a few seconds after
 *    their last touch: the agent is told it is held and goes on to something
 *    else, instead of overwriting it or being stopped by it.
 *  - Control. The person can take a whole surface (the app window, say) and
 *    hand it back; while they hold it the agent does not use it.
 *  - What they did. Said to the agent at its next step, once, in a line a
 *    collaborator would say ("they moved the signature"), so it can answer in
 *    kind and carry on without undoing it.
 *
 * Pure -- a clock in, text out -- so the rules are tested without a page.
