/**
 * Messages that want a quick word back and nothing else: a hello, a thank-you,
 * "this is just a test".
 *
 * Such a turn used to cost the same as a job. Agent mode planned first (a
 * `set_mode` round before anything was said), the model thought before each
 * round, and when the message named a colleague the lead took one more round
 * afterwards to retell what the colleague had already said. A greeting took
 * most of a minute and cost real money.
 *
 * The list is deliberately narrow. A word that can also mean "go ahead" (ok,
 * yes, sure, do it, great) is never here: answering that quickly would drop
 * the work it was asking for. A message that is wrongly missed is only slow
 * the way it always was; one wrongly caught would be answered without a plan.
