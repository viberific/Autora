/**
 * When not to be proactive.
 *
 * Everything else in this console is about being useful ahead of being asked:
 * jobs that outlive the turn, schedules that look at things and say when they
 * changed, agreements that stop the same question coming twice. The failure
 * mode of all of it is the same one -- something arriving at an hour nobody
 * wanted to hear from a machine. A nightly build notice at 03:40 is not
 * helpfulness, it is a notification someone cannot switch off.
 *
 * So: a window, in the person's own clock, during which nothing unprompted is
 * said. Not a shutdown: a question they ask at 03:40 is answered at 03:40,
 * schedules they set still run (that is them asking for it), and a job
 * started by hand still starts. What waits is the agent's own initiative --
 * the briefing about a job that finished, a note it wanted to leave, starting
 * something new on its own account. Held, not dropped: the next turn after
 * the window carries it in full.
 *
 * See server.ts for where the briefing is held back, and Settings for the two
 * times.
