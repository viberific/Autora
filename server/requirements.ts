/**
 * What the person asked for, kept whole.
 *
 * A big message, or a conversation that keeps adding to one, is many asks, and
 * the to-do list the agent writes is its own reading of them: an ask it leaves
 * off the list is an ask nothing ever checks. The history is rebuilt from the
 * log as words and then folded into a summary, so an ask buried in a long
 * message is the first thing paraphrased away. This is the list that does not
 * lose them: each ask kept verbatim, in the person's words, with a status, and
 * amended in place when the person changes their mind -- an edit, a removal, a
 * new item -- rather than replaced.
 *
 * Like the to-do list and the ledger it lives in the log (`requirements.update`
 * holds the whole list as it now stands), is told to the agent every turn, and
 * holds no state of its own. Pure: a log in, a list or a briefing out.
