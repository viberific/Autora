/**
 * What the workspace keeps, and what it lets go.
 *
 * Nothing here had a policy: sessions, their logs and the Artifacts page grew
 * for as long as the app was installed, and the only way to get disk back was
 * to delete a thread by hand, one at a time. On a box that Umbrel shares with
 * everything else that is a slow leak with a bad ending, and the person
 * cannot see it happening because no screen says how much is stored.
 *
 * Two rules, both conservative, and both sayable out loud: nothing older than
 * the age limit, and never fewer than the newest N of anything. Pinned
 * sessions are never touched, and neither is a session that is busy. The
 * defaults are deliberately shy -- half a year, five hundred sessions -- so
 * that this is housekeeping rather than a thing that eats somebody's work.
