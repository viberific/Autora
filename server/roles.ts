/**
 * Roles: which model does which part of the work.
 *
 * Settings names the main model and, beside it, up to three more. The main one
 * builds: it does the many rounds of tool calls that make up most of a task, so
 * it is the one worth making cheap. The planner, when one is named, thinks the
 * task through while the chat is planning (Agent mode's planning rounds, and
 * every round of a chat in Plan mode). Talk mode's fast model speaks. The
 * background model folds old turns, learns and remarks. The planner and the
 * background model may be another provider's (a Claude planner over a DeepSeek
 * builder), so each is a whole Target: provider, model, key and address. Any of
 * them left empty falls back to the rule that held before roles existed, so an
 * install that names none behaves exactly as it did.
 *
 * Switching model only happens where the work already changes hands: at
 * set_mode, at a handover in talk mode, and in background calls that carry no
 * conversation. A model's prompt cache is its own, so every switch costs one
 * uncached read of the conversation by the model taking over; that is why
 * small talk keeps the main model (which already answers it without thinking)
 * rather than having a role of its own. Another vendor reading the history is
 * safe because the history is kept in one neutral shape (ChatMessage in
 * ./llm) and rebuilt in each vendor's own shape on every call.
 *
 * Escalation is what keeps a cheap builder safe. A cheap model is poor at
 * noticing that it is stuck, so the signals Autora already raises -- the loop
 * watch, the error budget, the stall checkpoint, a project check that keeps
 * failing -- hand the work back to the planner, which looks again (read-only)
 * and switches to build when it has a way forward. The stops behind those
 * signals stay where they were; escalation comes before them, a bounded number
 * of times per turn.
