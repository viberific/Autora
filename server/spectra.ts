/**
 * Spectra-PDF's window, served by Autora.
 *
 * Spectra's own editor (spectra-editor/) is built into Autora, and behind it
 * sits Spectra's own Python engine: 221 PDF operations — OCR, redaction,
 * signatures, acroform, preflight, accessibility — answering JSON-RPC over
 * stdin. Nothing of either is rewritten. What this file is, then, is the two
 * ends of the pipe and the session they belong to:
 *
 *   - `POST /api/spectra/invoke`  one renderer command, answered here
 *     (server/spectra/commands.ts).
 *   - an event channel for the engine's replies and its progress, either
 *     through Autora's own socket (the app, where the window relays them into
 *     the frame) or over `/api/spectra/events` (the page opened on its own,
 *     for development).
 *
 * Everything the engine touches is per document session, as the PDF desk is:
 * its working folder, its two engine processes (interactive and health), and
 * the file the window is showing.
