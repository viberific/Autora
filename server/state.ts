/**
 * Everything the console remembers between restarts: which model to call,
 * which keys to call it with, the standing instructions, and what has been
 * spent so far.
 *
 * It lives in one JSON file under `.autora/` (gitignored), written whenever
 * something changes and read once at startup. Before this, settings were held
 * in a module-level object: a key pasted into the panel survived exactly as
 * long as the process did, which on a container that restarts on deploy is not
 * long, and the spend counter would have reset with it -- a bill that forgets
 * itself is not a bill.
 *
 * The file holds API keys in plain text, so it is created with owner-only
 * permissions and the settings panel says out loud where they are kept. Keys
 * set in the environment are still honoured and are never written here; the
 * environment wins nothing and loses nothing, it is simply the fallback when
 * the app has not been given a key of its own.
