/**
 * Sessions, memories and scheduled jobs, on disk.
 *
 * These used to be module-level arrays in server.ts, which meant every
 * restart -- and on Umbrel every update is a restart -- quietly emptied the
 * thread list, forgot everything the agent had written down, and put the demo
 * memories back. They now live beside the settings file, in the directory the
 * container keeps across an update.
 *
 * A session is a folder: `meta.json` for what can change (title, pin) and
 * `events.jsonl` for the log, which only ever grows, so an event costs one
 * appended line rather than a rewrite of the whole thread. Lines are queued
 * and written in batches, because a streamed reply is dozens of events a
 * second. Memories and jobs are small and are rewritten whole, a moment after
 * the last change.
 *
 * Pictures are not kept: they live in ./blobs, in memory, and a thread read
 * back after a restart shows where they were rather than what they showed.
