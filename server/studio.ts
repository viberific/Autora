/**
 * Autora Music: the music window, and the agent's hands on the same song.
 *
 * One song per chat. It lives here (the song is plain JSON, src/lib/studio/model.ts), and:
 *
 *   - the agent's `studio_*` tools edit it (`runStudioTool`), and every change is announced to the window, which
 *     loads the new song and shows the clips that moved;
 *   - the person works in the window (src/components/StudioWindow.tsx, which also plays it: the sound is Web
 *     Audio, made on the person's device) and what they change is put back here (`PUT /api/studio/:session/doc`),
 *     so the agent's next look sees it.
 *
 * Who made a change travels with it (`by`): the window reloads the song for the agent's changes and never for its
 * own person's, so a note being dragged is not interrupted by an echo of itself. A person's save that was based on
 * an older song than the agent has since changed is refused (409) rather than allowed to undo the agent's work
 * unseen; the window loads the newer one and says so.
 *
 * The three things only a browser can do -- make sound, stop it, bounce the song to a file -- are commands to the open
 * window (`command`), which does them and answers. The agent cannot hear; playing is for the person.
