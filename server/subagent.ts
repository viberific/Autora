/**
 * A worker with a clean head, for questions that would otherwise fill the
 * main thread with search results.
 *
 * "Where is the retry logic and what does it do?" costs a dozen searches and
 * file reads, and every one of them stays in the main agent's context for the
 * rest of the turn, crowding out the task. This runs that work in its own
 * loop: a fresh context, read-only tools, a hard step limit, and the same loop
 * watch and schema check as the main one. Only a short report comes back; the
 * pages it read never reach the thread's context.
 *
 * Pure apart from what it is given: the model and the tools are passed in, so
 * the loop is the same whatever provider answers and is tested with a script.
