/**
 * What to suggest: the things this install could do for the person, worked
 * out from what is actually here rather than from a list of examples.
 *
 * The hardest thing about an agent is knowing what to ask it. A new chat used
 * to open on four fixed examples -- a Hacker News summary, a made-up site to
 * watch -- which say what an agent is in general and nothing about what this
 * one can do for this person. Everything here is read from the install
 * instead: the disk it is on, the apps running beside it, the sites its browser
 * is signed in to, what it remembers about the person, what is scheduled and
 * how that went. No model is asked, so a suggestion costs nothing to make, and
 * a suggestion with nothing behind it is not made: an empty list is an honest
 * answer, and the chat then falls back to the examples.
 *
 * Three kinds, all pure so they can be tested without a machine:
 *
 *  - starters: one-tap tasks for an empty chat;
 *  - offers: a schedule worth setting up, asked once and never again;
 *  - next steps: what to do after a turn -- watching a page it read, plus
 *    the follow-ups the look back thought of.
 *
 * Every task here reports and changes nothing, and nothing outward-facing is
 * ever suggested: a message, a post or a purchase is the person's to start.
