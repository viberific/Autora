/**
 * What each task cost, and whether it was done well.
 *
 * The spend ledger (state.ts `usage`) is one row per model call, with no idea
 * what the call was for. This is the other half: one record per turn -- a
 * "task" -- holding the money every call made on its behalf, the kind of work
 * it was, and what is known about how it ended. Read together over time they
 * answer "what does a good result cost, on this model, for this kind of work".
 *
 * A figure like that is only worth having if it can be checked, so every part
 * of it is mechanical:
 *
 *  - Cost is the sum of the ledger's own rows for the turn. `AsyncLocalStorage`
 *    carries the task through every `await` of the turn, so a call is billed to
 *    the task that made it: the model's own rounds, the voice, compaction, a
 *    sub-agent and the look back after the turn -- and not a remark or a Threads
 *    post that merely happened at the same time.
 *  - The kind of work is read from the tools the turn called, never guessed by a
 *    model (`kindOfCall`).
 *  - "Done well" is only ever the person's own mark, or a plain-code fact: the
 *    check they set for their project passed or failed, or the turn ended in an
 *    error. A turn with none of those is *unjudged*, and is counted as that --
 *    not as good, and not as poor.
 *
 * Nothing here writes to the chat, and an incognito chat leaves no record.
