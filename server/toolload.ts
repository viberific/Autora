/**
 * Which tools the model is shown, and when a specialist set is brought in.
 *
 * Every tool's schema is sent on every call. The whole set is about eighteen
 * thousand tokens, and most of a chat never touches the PDF editor, the widget
 * builder or the scheduler: it pays for them anyway, and a model reading
 * sixty-odd tool descriptions picks worse than one reading thirty. So the
 * specialist sets start out of the list, named in one line each, and come in
 * when they are wanted -- the person's words or a file say so, the agent calls
 * one of the tools, or the agent asks for the set with `tools_enable`.
 *
 * What was loaded is read back off the log (a tool call, or a `tools.enable`
 * event), so it holds across turns, interruptions and restarts without a
 * store of its own. Pure: a log and a message in, a set of names out.
