/**
 * What the agent can actually do.
 *
 * One registry, and it is the only answer to that question. The system prompt
 * is generated from it, the model's tool schemas are generated from it, the
 * Settings panel renders from it, and the executor dispatches through it. There
 * is deliberately no second list: the failure this module exists to end was a
 * console that advertised a terminal in its memory graph, described one in its
 * README, drew one in the transcript, and had no way to run a command.
 *
 * Four groups. The first three are three genuinely different machines:
 *
 *   terminal  -- the host Autora itself runs on. In the Umbrel container that
 *                is the container, and `sudo` there is usually unnecessary
 *                rather than unavailable.
 *   browser   -- a real Chromium this server drives (see ./browser.ts).
 *   computer  -- somebody's actual desktop, over the relay (see ./desktop.ts).
 *   memory    -- the workspace graph, which outlives the session.
 *
 * A group can be *off* (nobody turned it on) or *unavailable* (turned on, but
 * the thing it needs is not there -- no Chromium installed, no relay dialled
 * in). Those are different sentences and the agent is told which it is, because
 * "I can't browse" and "Chromium isn't installed on the server" send the reader
 * to two very different places.
