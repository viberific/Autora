/**
 * What the vendor's own till says.
 *
 * DeepSeek publishes no usage endpoint -- /user/balance is the only money its
 * API will talk about, and per-key usage exists only as a CSV export behind a
 * login. Real spend therefore cannot be read off directly: it is what has been
 * paid in, less what is left, and that difference is the one figure which
 * cannot be wrong, because it is the vendor's own arithmetic on the vendor's
 * own money.
 *
 * It matters because counting tokens here will always come out low. A call
 * that ended before it reported its tokens -- an answer stopped mid-sentence,
 * an attempt retried after a dropped connection -- is still charged and leaves
 * no row on the ledger. So the balance is used as the truth about the total,
 * and the ledger keeps doing what it is good at: saying where the money went.
 *
 * Payments are observed rather than asked about. The balance is read every so
 * often, and a reading that has gone UP since the last one is money added, so
 * the amount paid in has to be right once and keeps itself right afterwards.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a number. With no readable balance, no known amount
 * paid in, or a balance sitting above what was paid in (a stale figure, a
 * refund), every caller is told "not known" and falls back to counting.
 *
 * Whose money it is, is the whole point. A balance belongs to one vendor, and
 * only three of them publish one at all; for years this read DeepSeek's
 * whatever provider was selected, so the headline spend was DeepSeek's money
 * against somebody else's usage. Everything here is therefore per provider, and
 * a provider with no balance endpoint gets no figure rather than a borrowed one.
