 * was told none of it, so it answered questions about its own abilities by
 * guessing, and guessed wrong in both directions.
 *
 * Every row is the same registry the model's tool schemas are built from (see
 * server/tools.ts), so what this panel says is what the agent gets. Turning a
 * group off removes those tools from the model's next request entirely and
 * changes the sentence it is given about that group; it is not a UI preference.
 *
 * Changes apply on their own rather than waiting for Save at the top: a
 * capability switch that needs a second click somewhere else to take effect is
 * how you end up believing the terminal is off when it is not.
