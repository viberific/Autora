/**
 * The two choices a chat carries, as the page knows them: how the agent works
 * (Build, Plan, Agent -- the selector in the message box) and what may run
 * without a yes (Yolo, Ask -- the selector in the header). The server decides
 * what each means (server/modes.ts); this is only what the page says. The
 * suggestions for "when to ask" are the same wording the server's checking
 * model reads, and tests/modes.test.ts holds the two files to each other.
