/**
 * The pinned stage: which of the things the agent shows are held in view.
 *
 * A page the agent is working, its plan and an explainer it drew all appear in
 * the thread where they happened -- and on a phone the next reply pushes each
 * of them up out of sight, so watching one means scrolling back for it every
 * time. On a phone they are held in one panel above the thread instead, with
 * tabs for whichever exist, and the thread keeps the words.
 *
 * Which cells are held is decided here, from the derived thread and nothing
 * else, so that any one of the three alone or any mix of them takes the same
 * path: a list of surfaces, at most one per kind, newest first-shown.
