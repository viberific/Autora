/**
 * The automation budget: the guard that has to work while nobody is looking.
 *
 * It is checked in two places -- before a job starts, and every round of a run
 * already going -- and its whole point is what it must never do: delete a job,
 * clear a cron, or stop a turn the person is having. So the tests are about
 * the arithmetic of the day rolling over, the clamps, and which of the two
 * questions each check answers.
