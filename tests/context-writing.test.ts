/**
 * A message is finished before a fold lands.
 *
 * The person's ask: the agent must always be able to finish the output it is
 * writing -- the message they are reading -- before the context is compacted,
 * so compaction can never be the reason a reply stops mid-sentence.
 *
 * Folding runs in the background while the turn keeps working, which is what
 * makes it cheap and is also exactly what made this possible: the swap
 * replaced the history under a reply that was still being written. The rule
 * now is that no fold is begun while a message is in flight, and one already
 * asked for waits for the message to finish before it lands.
