/**
 * Pinning one model to one endpoint of a vendor that routes.
 *
 * One endpoint of the chosen model, since OpenRouter serves the same model
 * from several and will otherwise pick a different one -- another machine, at
 * another price -- from call to call. A pin names one and refuses the rest, which is a routing
 * block in the request body. This file is about that block: that it is there
 * when a pin is set, that it is absent when none is (nobody who never chose
 * one gets a different request than before), that it never travels to a
 * vendor that does not route, and that setting, changing and clearing one
 * behaves.
 *
 * The body is read off a real HTTP server rather than a stubbed fetch: what
 * the vendor receives is the thing in question, and an assertion against our
 * own variable would pass however the body were assembled.
 *
