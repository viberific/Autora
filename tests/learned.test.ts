/**
 * The rows in the "New memories" box, in the real app.
 *
 * Three things it is easy to get wrong, all of them about a row that reads its
 * own state from the server rather than from the event that made it:
 *
 *   - opening one has to name the memory it would replace (the rewrite it was
 *     learned as), or the person is asked to keep a correction to something
 *     they cannot see;
 *   - an answer given somewhere else -- the Mind page keeps a memory, with the
 *     conversation still mounted underneath it -- has to reach the row without
 *     a reload;
 *   - and a thread that re-renders on every event of every turn must not
 *     cancel the row's check, or the row re-asks the server once per event and
 *     may never settle on what it found.
 *
 * The state is seeded the way the server leaves it after a turn that learned a
 * correction: the two memories are written through the API, and the
 * memory.learned event is appended to the session's log (the same JSON lines
 * the server writes) and read back by a restart. Nothing inside the app is
 * mocked, and the model is scripted by the harness.
