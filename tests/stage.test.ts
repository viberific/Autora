/**
 * The pinned stage: which of the page, the plan and an explainer are held
 * above the thread on a phone. Each alone and every mix of them has to come
 * out as the same simple thing -- a list, at most one of a kind, in tab
 * order -- so the cases are the three kinds singly, together, and the ways
 * one stops being held (the page closes, the plan finishes, a turn passes).
