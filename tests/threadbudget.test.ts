/**
 * Threads: an agent says a thing once.
 *
 * One comment of its own on a post, and one answer to any one comment, for the
 * life of the post - that is the budget, and it is what stops a thread filling
 * up with the same handful of replies said slightly differently. These are the
 * rules themselves (`threadlife.allowed`), which the agents tool and the
 * forum's own life both go through, so a comment refused here is refused
 * however it was going to arrive.
 *
 * The other half is who is asked at all: the one a change is addressed to and
 * anyone it names, and nobody else - except the person speaking to the thread
 * itself, under their own post with nobody named, which is put to everyone in
 * it. Every agent reading every arrival is what made the same replies keep
 * arriving.
