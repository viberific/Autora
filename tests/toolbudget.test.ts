/**
 * What every model call carries before the conversation: the tool schemas of
 * the default set and the capability briefing.
 *
 * Measured at 0.9.159: 51 tools, 44 KB of schema (~11k tokens), and a 16 KB
 * briefing (~4k tokens). It is paid on every cache miss and in full by vendors
 * that do not cache, so growth should be a decision rather than a drift:
 * raise the budget here on purpose, in the change that adds the weight.

// Raised to 48_200 (2026-10-16): main stood at exactly 48,000; artifact_list and artifact_save now say that files live in
// one folder per project (the composer's Artifacts button attaches project folders), +66 chars after trimming both.
// Raised again, to 48_700 (2026-10-16): memory_link, the tool that connects two memories (~420 chars with its schema).
// Raised again, to 50_000 (2026-10-18): the skill tool (~1,100 chars, kept short: when to use it is in the briefing), always
// offered because a skill is how work is done without working the method out again.
const SCHEMA_BUDGET_CHARS = 50_000;
// Raised from 17,500 for the windows overview (server/handbook.ts): the manuals themselves are not in the briefing, they arrive with a window's first call.
// Raised again, to 22_000: on CI the browser, memory and voice groups are all available, and their guides are in the briefing (20,871 chars there before Autora Photo's line, about 18,000 on a machine without a browser).
// Raised again, to 24_000: the tool bars add each window's bar and All-tools grid to the guides; CI measured 23,354 chars, about 21,500 on a machine without a browser.
// Raised again, to 25_000 (2026-10-11): five commits had added their weight without it -- 4da9831 and 9ededd7 (the working agent's cursor and what it says it is doing there), 01d5cb4 (no Threads from handed-down work), 2f5b8b8 (to-do cards carry their steps; the bar counts credit left), 6896367 (the memory card opens the memory; the lead routes work to agents). CI measured 24,249 chars (~6,062 tokens) against the old 24,000.
// Raised again, to 26_000 (2026-10-16): the overview's "Saving and files" (Save, project folders, Load in every window, the
// composer's Artifacts button) and the scripts-only schedule line, both trimmed; CI measured 26,473 before the trim, about
// 25,700 after (24,151 on a machine without a browser).
// Raised again, to 26_600 (2026-10-18): the skill library's line and the list of skills (empty here; each skill adds its name
// and description, which is the point: the instructions stay out until one is used). +506 chars on a machine without a browser.
