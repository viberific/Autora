/**
 * The real total: what has been paid in, less what the vendor says is left.
 *
 * The number this replaces is counted from token counts, and counting cannot
 * see a call that was charged without reporting what it used -- an answer
 * stopped mid-sentence, an attempt retried after a dropped connection. So the
 * counted figure is always the lower of the two and the gap is invisible,
 * which is the whole reason the balance is used instead.
 *
 * What is checked here is that arithmetic, and the rule it is built on: it
 * invents nothing. No balance read, nothing known to have been paid in, or a
 * balance sitting above what was paid in all mean "not known", and every
 * caller then falls back to counting.
